A ChorusSoundEffect simulates the effect of multiple vocals or instruments playing the same part. It does this by taking the original sound and overlaying copies of that sound. These copies are not exact matches to the original but instead vary in pitch slightly. This simulates a real chorus, as different singers or instruments will have slight variations. This effect can be applied to either an individual sound or to a sound group by parenting it to the desired instance.

Like all other `SoundEffect`, a ChorusSoundEffect can be applied either to a `Sound` or `SoundGroup` by being parented to either.
