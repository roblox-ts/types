The SortOrder property determines the next UI element to be placed in a layout. For Name, a simple alphabetic sort is used on the Name property of the child UI elements. For LayoutOrder, a low-to-high sort is used on the [GuiObject.LayoutOrder](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/GuiObject/LayoutOrder) property of child UI elements. If two share the same [GuiObject.LayoutOrder](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/GuiObject/LayoutOrder), whichever was added sooner to the parent object takes precedence. An easy way to reverse the sorting order is to negate LayoutOrder.
