RemoveTag will remove some tag from some object. This method will not throw an error if the object did not have the tag in the first place. Successfully removing a tag will fire a signal created by [CollectionService.GetInstanceRemovedSignal](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/CollectionService/GetInstanceRemovedSignal) with the given tag.

When removing a tag, it is common that some resources are used to give the tag its functionality, e.g. event connections or tables. To prevent memory leaks, it is a good idea to clean these up (disconnect, set to nil, etc) when no longer needed for a tag.
