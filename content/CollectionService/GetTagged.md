GetTagged returns a table of objects with a given tag which are descendants of the `DataModel` (`game`). Such tags have been added using [CollectionService.AddTag](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/CollectionService/AddTag), and removing a tag using [CollectionService.RemoveTag](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/CollectionService/RemoveTag) will ensure this method does not return them. Although the name of this method is past-tense, this method only returns objects **presently** tagged with the given tag. It will not return objects that once had a tag but no longer have it.

If you want to detect all objects with a tag, both present and future, use this method to iterate over objects while also making a connection to a signal returned by [CollectionService.GetinstanceAddedSignal](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=GetinstanceAddedSignal).

This method does not guarantee any ordering of the returned objects. Additionally, it is possible that objects can have the given tag assigned to them, but not be a descendant of the `DataModel`, i.e. its parent is nil. This method will not return such objects.
