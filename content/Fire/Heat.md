The Heat property determines how fast particles are emit from the `Fire` object. It is limited to the range [-25, 25]. Positive values are in the top (+Y) direction of the parent `BasePart` or `Attachment`. It also affects the [ParticleEmitter.Acceleration](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Acceleration) of the inner particles. Below, you can see the effects of higher heat on the velocity/acceleration of the flame particles (left has Heat = 9, right has Heat = 18).
