The SecondaryColor property determines the color of the smaller particles emit by a `Fire` object. It is essentially the color of the inner portion of the flame. Below, you can see the SecondaryColor of the flame is set to white to differentiate with the larger, outer particles which have [Fire.Color](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Fire/Color) set to blue. It should be noted that the inner particles use a [ParticleEmitter.LightEmission](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/LightEmission) of 1, so darker colors will instead cause the particles to appear transparent (and therefore black will stop rendering inner particles altogether).
