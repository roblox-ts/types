The Dialog object allows users to create non-player characters (NPCs) that players can talk to using a list of choices. The Dialog object can be inserted into a part such as a Humanoid's head, and then a player will see a speech bubble above the part that they can click on to start a conversation. The creator of a place can choose what choices the player can say by inserting `DialogChoice` objects into the dialog.
