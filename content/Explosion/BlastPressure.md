Used to determine the amount of force applied to `BasePart`s caught in the [Explosion.BlastRadius](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Explosion/BlastRadius).

Currently this level of force applied does not vary based on distance from [Explosion.Position](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Explosion/Position). Unanchored `BaseParts` will accelerate equally away from the origin regardless of distance provided they are within the blast radius.

The blast pressure determines the acceleration of parts due to an explosion. It does not determine the degree to which joints are broken. When [Explosion.DestroyJointRadiusPercent](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Explosion/DestroyJointRadiusPercent) is equal to 1 all joints between parts in the [Explosion.BlastRadius](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Explosion/BlastRadius) will be destroyed provided BlastPressure is greater than 0.

The BlastPressure also does not determine the amount of damage given to `Terrain`. Provided BlastPressure is greater than 0 and [Explosion.ExplosionType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Explosion/ExplosionType) isn't set to Enum.ExplosionType.NoCraters the size of the crater created is determined exclusively by the [Explosion.BlastRadius](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Explosion/BlastRadius).

Setting BlastPressure to 0 eliminates the effect of the explosion and is useful when developers want to program their own custom behavior for explosions using the [Explosion.Hit](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Explosion/Hit) event.
