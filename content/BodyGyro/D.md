The D property is how much **dampening** will be applied to the torque used to reach the goal [CFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyGyro/CFrame). When the part approaches the goal orientation it needs to decelerate, otherwise it will rotate past the goal and have to stop and re-accelerate back toward the goal. This is often creates undesirable **rubber-banding** effect, so applying dampening using this property is how that effect is avoided. The higher this value is set, the greater the dampening curve becomes, or the slower the part will approach the goal orientation.
