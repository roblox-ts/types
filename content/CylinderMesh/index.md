The CylinderMesh object applies a 'cylinder' mesh to the `BasePart` it is parented to.

What does a CylinderMesh do?

----------------------------

A CylinderMesh gives the `BasePart` it was applied to a cylinder shaped mesh.

The mesh applied gives the same appearance as that due to the [SpecialMesh.MeshType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SpecialMesh/MeshType) of a `SpecialMesh` being set to 'Cylinder' or [Part.Shape](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Part/Shape) being set to 'Cylinder'. However, unlike those two cases, it is orientated so that the height of the cylinder is along the `BasePart`'s Y axis.

The dimensions of the mesh scale relative to the [BasePart.Size](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Size) of the `BasePart`. This scale is uniformly along the `BasePart`'s Y axis and maintaining a 1:1 ratio for the part’s X and Z axis, using the lowest value. This means the `BasePart` can be resized normally, but the cross section of the cylinder will always remain a circle and cannot be stretched or compressed.

Note as the CylinderMesh object does not include a texture the [DataModelMesh.VertexColor](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/DataModelMesh/VertexColor) property does not do anything.

## Why use a CylinderMesh?

The advantage of using a mesh over setting the [Part.Shape](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Part/Shape) property of a part to 'Cylinder' is that the [DataModelMesh.Scale](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/DataModelMesh/Scale) and [DataModelMesh.Offset](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/DataModelMesh/Offset) properties are exposed. These allow the position and dimensions of the mesh that is displayed to be changed without changing the [BasePart.Position](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Position) or [BasePart.Size](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Size) of the `Part` the mesh is parented to.

The key difference between a CylinderMesh or a `SpecialMesh` with [SpecialMesh.MeshType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/SpecialMesh/MeshType) set to 'Cylinder' is the orientation of the cylinder mesh. With a CylinderMesh, the height of the cylinder is aligned with the height (Y axis) of the part. With a `SpecialMesh` (or `Part` with [Part.Shape](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Part/Shape) set to 'Cylinder'), the height of the cylinder is aligned with the X axis.
