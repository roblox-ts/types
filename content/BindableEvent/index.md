**Note:** If a Table is passed as an argument to a BindableEvent it must be an array without missing entries or have string keys, not a mixture, or else the string keys will be lost. Allows events defined in one script to be subscribed to by another script. However, please note that BindableEvents do not allow for communication between the server and client. If you are looking for this functionality use `RemoteEvent`.
