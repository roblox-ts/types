A **RemoteEvent** is designed to provide a one-way message between the server and clients, allowing [Scripts](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Script) to call code in [LocalScripts](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/LocalScript) and vice-versa. This message can be directed from one client to the server, from the server to a particular client, or from the server to all clients.

In order for both the server and clients to utilize a remote event, the RemoteEvent object itself must be in a place where both sides can see it. As such, we recommend that you store the RemoteEvent inside of `ReplicatedStorage`, although in some cases it's appropriate to store it in the workspace or inside a `Tool`.

If you need the result of the call, you should use a `RemoteFunction` instead. Otherwise a remote event is recommended since it will minimize network traffic/latency and won't yield the script to wait for a response.
