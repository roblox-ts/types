The CenterOfMass property describes the position in which a [part](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/BasePart)'s [center of mass][1] is located. Should a force be applied to the part toward this point, the part would not rotate as a result of this force. **CenterOfMass is currently not enabled.**
