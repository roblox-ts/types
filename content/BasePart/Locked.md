The Locked property determines whether a [part](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/BasePart) (or a [model](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Model) it is contained within) may be selected in Roblox Studio by clicking on it. This property is most often enabled on parts within environment models that aren't being edited at the moment. Roblox Studio has a Lock/Unlock All tool that can toggle the Locked state of every part descendant in a model at once.
