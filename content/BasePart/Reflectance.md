The Reflectance property determines how much a [part](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/BasePart) reflects the skybox.  A value of 0 indicates the part is not reflective at all, and a value of 1 indicates the part should fully reflect.

Reflectance is not affected by [BasePart.Transparency](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Transparency), unless the part is fully transparent, in which case reflectance will not render at all. Reflectance may or may not be ignored depending on the [BasePart.Material](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Material) of the part.
