The ResizeableFaces property (with an **e**, not ResizableFaces) describes using a Faces object the different faces on which a part may be resized. For most implementations of `/BasePart`, such as `/Part` and `/WedgePart`, this property includes all faces. However, `/TrussPart` will set its ResizeableFaces set to only two faces since those kinds of parts must have two [BasePart.Size](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Size) dimensions of length 2. This property is most commonly used with tools used for building and manipulating parts and has little use outside of that context. The `/Handles` class, which has the [Handles.Faces](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Handles/Faces) property, can be used in conjunction with this property to display only the handles on faces that can be resized on a part.
