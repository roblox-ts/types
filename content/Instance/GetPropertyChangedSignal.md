This method returns an event that behaves exactly like the `Changed` event, except that the event only fires when the given property changes. It's generally a good idea to use this method instead of a connection to `Changed` with a function that checks the property name. Subsequent calls to this method on the same object with the same property name return the same event.

`print(object:GetPropertyChangedSignal("Name") == object:GetPropertyChangedSignal("Name")) --&gt; always true`

`ValueBase` objects, such as `IntValue` and `StringValue`, use a modified `Changed` event that fires with the contents of the `Value` property. As such, this method provides a way to detect changes in other properties of those objects. For example, to detect changes in the `Name` property of an `IntValue`, use `IntValue:GetPropertyChangedSignal("Name"):Connect(someFunc)` since the `Changed` event of `IntValue` objects only detect changes on the `Value` property.
