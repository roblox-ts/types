The P property determines how much [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)) is used while applying force in order to reach the goal [Position](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyPosition/Position). The higher this value, the more power will be used and the faster it will be used.

The force the `BodyPosition` exerts increases as the difference between the part's current position and the goal position increases. This property is multiplied to this force to either amplify or diminish it.
