PostEffect is an abstract base class for post-processing effects, such as `BloomEffect` and `ColorCorrectionEffect`. They change how the world looks **after** it has been rendered. They do not affect `GuiObject`s. Objects of this kind should be parented to the `Lighting` or the [Workspace.CurrentCamera](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Workspace/CurrentCamera) in order to work.

It should also be noted that some post-processing effects will work differently or **not at all** when Roblox is set to a low [QualityLevel](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/RenderSettings/QualityLevel) (or [EditQualityLevel](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/RenderSettings/EditQualityLevel) in Studio). On some low-end devices, faster rendering algorithms may be used. By default, these quality settings are set to Automatic, so if you aren't seeing post-processing effects you should check Roblox's settings under the "Rendering" section. It may be necessary to override the automatic behavior temporarily in order to preview post-processing effects.
