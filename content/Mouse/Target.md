The object in 3D space the [mouse](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Mouse) is pointing to.

## Notes

 - If [Mouse.TargetFilter](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Mouse/TargetFilter) has been set, the target filter and its descendants will be ignored.

 - When the mouse is not pointing at a `BasePart`, for example when it is pointing at the sky, Target will be nil.

 - Developers looking for the position of the mouse in 3D space should use [Mouse.Hit](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Mouse/Hit).
