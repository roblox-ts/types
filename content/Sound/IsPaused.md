This read-only property will return true when the `Sound` is not playing. Note that this property will not only return true once a sound has been paused using the [Sound.Pause](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Sound/Pause) function but also if it has been stopped using the [Sound.Stop](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Sound/Stop) function or never been played.

This property will only be true when [Sound.IsPlaying](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/IsPlaying) is false.

As IsPaused is read only it can not be used to stop the sound, [Sound.Stop](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Sound/Stop) and [Sound.Pause](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Sound/Pause) should be used instead.
