Determines the speed at which a `Sound` will play. The greater the value the faster the sound will play back.

For example, a value of 2 will cause the `Sound` to play 2x faster, whereas a value of 0.5 will cause it to play 2x slower. When PlaybackSpeed is equal to 1, the sound will take [Sound.TimeLength](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sound/TimeLength) (in seconds) to complete.

Note that increasing the PlaybackSpeed of a sound will cause it to play at a higher pitch.
