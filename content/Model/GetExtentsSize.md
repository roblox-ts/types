Returns the size of the smallest bounding box that contains all of the `BasePart`s in the `Model`. If [Model.PrimaryPart](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Model/PrimaryPart) exists then the bounding box will be aligned to that part. If a primary part has not been set then the function will chose a part in the model to align the bounding box to. As the the selection of this part is not deterministic it is recommended to set a [Model.PrimaryPart](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Model/PrimaryPart) to get consistent results with this function.

Note this function only returns the size of the smallest bounding box, and the developer must employ their own method to obtain the position of the bounding box.
@returns The `DataType/Vector3` extents size of the `Model`.
