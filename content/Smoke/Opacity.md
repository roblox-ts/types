Opacity determines the opaqueness of the smoke particles. It must be in the range [0, 1]. This property works **inversely** in comparison to a part's [BasePart.Transparency](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Transparency) or ParticleEmitter's [ParticleEmitter.Transparency](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Transparency): a value of 0 is completely invisible, 1 is completely visible. Below, the left `Smoke` effect has an Opacity of 0.25 (or, 25%), the center has the default 0.5 (50%), and the right has 1.0 (or 100%).

![Smoke with varying opacity levels][1]

It should be noted that the texture that Roblox uses for `Smoke` particles is partially transparent, so setting this property to 1 will still yield transparency in rendered smoke.
