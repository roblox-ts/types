Sets the distance at which this player will see other Humanoid’s names. If set to 0, names are hidden.

The NameDisplayDistance `StarterPlayer` property sets the distance in studs at which this player will see other `Humanoid`’s names. If set to 0, names are hidden. This property is set to 100 studs by default.

To change the display distance for a player once they join the game, you can set the [Player.NameDisplayDistance](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/NameDisplayDistance) property.

## Note

If a Humanoid's name is visible, you can set the display type using [Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Humanoid/DisplayDistanceType).
