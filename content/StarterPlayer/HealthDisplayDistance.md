The HealthDisplayDistance `StarterPlayer` property sets the distance in studs at which this player will see other `Humanoid`’s health bars. If set to 0, the health bars will not be displayed. This property is set to 100 studs by default.

To change the display distance for a player once they join the game, you can set the [Player.HealthDisplayDistance](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/HealthDisplayDistance) property.

## Note

If a Humanoid's health bar is visible, you can set the display type using [Humanoid.DisplayDistanceType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Humanoid/DisplayDistanceType).
