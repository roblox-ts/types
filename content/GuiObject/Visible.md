This property determines whether a [GUI](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/GuiObject) will render shapes, images and/or text on screen. If set to false, the GUI and all of its descedants (children) will not render.

The rendering of individual components of a GUI can be controlled individually through transparency properties such as  [GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/GuiObject/BackgroundTransparency), [TextLabel.TextTransparency](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/TextLabel/TextTransparency) and [ImageLabel.ImageTransparency](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ImageLabel/ImageTransparency).

When this property is true, the GUI will be ignored by `UIGridStyleLayout` objects (such as `UIGridLayout`, `UIListLayout` and `UITableLayout`). In other words, the space that the element would otherwise occupy in the layout is used by other elements instead.
