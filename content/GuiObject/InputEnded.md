The InputEnded event fires when a user stops interacting via a Human-Computer Interface device (Mouse button down, touch begin, keyboard button down, etc).

The `UserInputService` has a similarly named event that is not restricted to a specific UI element: [UserInputService.InputEnded](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/UserInputService/InputEnded).

This event will always fire regardless of game state.
