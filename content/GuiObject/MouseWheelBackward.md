The WheelBackward event fires when a user scrolls their mouse wheel back when the mouse is over a [GUI](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/GuiObject) element. It is similar to [Mouse.WheelBackward](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Mouse/WheelBackward), which fires regardless whether the user's mouse is over a GUI element.

This event fires merely as an indicator of the wheel's forward movement. This means that the x and y mouse coordinate arguments do not change as a result of this event. These coordinates only change when the mouse moves, which can be tracked by the [GuiObject.MouseMoved](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/GuiObject/MouseMoved) event.
