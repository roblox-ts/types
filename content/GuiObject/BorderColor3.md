BorderColor3 determines the color of a [UI](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/GuiObject) element's rectangular border (also known as the stroke color).

This is separate from the UI element's [GuiObject.BackgroundColor3](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/GuiObject/BackgroundColor3). If you set a UI element's border and background colors to the same color, you will be unable to distinguish the two.

Other properties properties that determine the visual properties of the border include [GuiObject.BorderSizePixel](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/GuiObject/BorderSizePixel) and [GuiObject.BackgroundTransparency](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/GuiObject/BackgroundTransparency).

Note that you will not be able to see an element's border if its BorderSizePixel property is set to 0.
