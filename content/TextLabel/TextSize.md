The TextSize property determines the pixel height of one line of rendered text. The unit is in screen pixels, not points (which is used in most document editing programs). It's worth noting that the "Legacy" font's line height behaves differently, and won't match this property exactly.

This property and [TextLabel.TextColor3](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/TextLabel/TextColor3), [TextLabel.TextTransparency](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/TextLabel/TextTransparency), [TextLabel.TextStrokeColor3](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/TextLabel/TextStrokeColor3) and [TextLabel.TextStrokeTransparency](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/TextLabel/TextStrokeTransparency) each influence the way text is rendered.

This property supersedes [TextLabel.FontSize](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/TextLabel/FontSize) since it is a number and not an enum. Internally, Roblox uses several sets of pre-rendered character images for each size of each font. It chooses the closest size to TextSize, then scales that set of character images to render text. Before the introduction of this property, you could only pick from the pre-rendered sizes, which were listed by the [Enum.FontSize](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=FontSize) enum.
