The P property determines how much [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(physics)) is used while applying force in order to reach the [Target](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/RocketPropulsion/Target) position. The higher this value, the more power will be used and the faster it will be used.

This property works similarly to [BodyPosition.P](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyPosition/P).
