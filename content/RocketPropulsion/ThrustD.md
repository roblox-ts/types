The D property is used to dampen the velocity of the part in order to prevent it from overshooting the [Target](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/RocketPropulsion/Target) and causing a **rubber-banding** effect. It behaves similarly to [BodyPosition.D](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyPosition/D).
