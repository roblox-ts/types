The CoreGui is a service used to store Guis created in-game by Roblox for the core user interface found in every game (such as the game menu, the playerlist, the backpack, etc.). It can also be used by [Plugins](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Plugin) in Roblox Studio.

You can use the [StarterGui.SetCoreGuiEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/StarterGui/SetCoreGuiEnabled) and [StarterGui.GetCoreGuiEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/StarterGui/GetCoreGuiEnabled) methods in a `LocalScript` to enable and disable most elements of the CoreGui. You can also use [PlayerGui.SetTopbarTransparency](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/PlayerGui/SetTopbarTransparency) to set the transparency of the top bar.
