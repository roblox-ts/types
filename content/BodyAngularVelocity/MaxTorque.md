The MaxTorque property determines the limit of the torque that may be exerted on each world axis. If a part isn't moving, consider raising this value (and also check that it is not [Anchored](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BasePart/Anchored) or attached to another anchored part). See also [P](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/BodyAngularVelocity/P) (power).
