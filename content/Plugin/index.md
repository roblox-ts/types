Plugin is the main object responsible for creating basic studio widgets. It is a custom add-on to Studio which adds new behavior and features that are not normally included.

Both the [Animation Editor](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=using%20animation%20editor) and [Terrain Tools](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Intro%20To%20Terrain) were originally developed as plugins. There are also many plugins made by the Roblox community that you can use to help make games and experiences.
