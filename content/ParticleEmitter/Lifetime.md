The Lifetime property defines the maximum and minimum ages a newly emit particle will. When a particle is emit, a random lifetime is chosen uniformly. Lifetimes are stored on a per-particle basis, so if this value is changed, existing particles will stay "alive" until their randomly chosen lifetime is lived. The bounds for this property should be in the range [0, 20]. By default, `ParticleEmitter`s will have a lifetime of 5 to 10 seconds. A lifetime of 0 will prevent particles from being emit in the first place.

it is important to pick a sensible Lifetime and [ParticleEmitter.Rate](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Rate) so that you don't have too many particles being rendered at once. Long lifetimes and high emission rates are a quick way to cause performance issues. If you need many particles, pick a balance of lifetime and rate. To instantly remove any presently emit particles (perhaps ones with absurdly long lifetimes), you can call [ParticleEmitter.Clear](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/ParticleEmitter/Clear).
