The Clear method will instantly destroy any existing particles that have been emit by the `ParticleEmitter` via its natural emission (nonzero [ParticleEmitter.Rate](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Rate) on an [ParticleEmitter.Enabled](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/Enabled) emitter) or via [ParticleEmitter.Emit](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/ParticleEmitter/Emit). It is not possible to clear individual particles - all are deleted at once.

Sometimes it is desirable to clear particles before teleporting a character so that there are no lingering effects that might follow due to [ParticleEmitter.LockedToPart](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ParticleEmitter/LockedToPart).
