When set to true, the solver will react as quickly as possible to move the attachments together. When false, the torque is dependent on [AlignPosition.MaxForce](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/AlignPosition/MaxForce), [AlignPosition.MaxVelocity](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/AlignPosition/MaxVelocity), and [AlignPosition.Responsiveness](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/AlignPosition/Responsiveness).
