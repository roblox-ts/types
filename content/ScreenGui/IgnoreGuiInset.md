IgnoreGuiInset is a boolean property of ScreenGuis that, when set to true, will force the [GUI Inset](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/GuiService/GetGuiInset) imposed by Roblox's CoreGuis to be ignored by this ScreenGui and its descendants. This means that an element with a UDim2 size of `{1,0},{1,0}` will fill up the entire screen, without a 36 pixel gap reserved for Roblox's top bar.
