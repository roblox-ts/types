The Image property is a content-type property that should hold the asset ID of a Decal or Image on the Roblox website. It functions identically to [Decal.Texture](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Decal/Texture) with regards to loading the image from the Roblox website. The rendered image will be colorized using [ImageButton.ImageColor3](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ImageButton/ImageColor3). It is possible to further manipulate the rendered image into sliced ([ImageButton.SliceCenter](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ImageButton/SliceCenter)), tiled ([ImageButton.ScaleType](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/ImageButton/ScaleType)) and nine-slice images using other image properties.
