AspectType determines what limits the maximum size of the element.

   - When set to FitWithinMaxSize, the constraint will make the object the maximum size it can be within its own [GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/GuiBase2d/AbsoluteSize).

  - When set to ScaleWithParentSize, the UI element's maximum size will be the size of the parent while still maintaining the aspect ratio..
