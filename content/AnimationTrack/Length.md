A read only property that returns the length (in seconds) of an `AnimationTrack`. This will return 0 until the animation has fully loaded and thus may not be immediately available.

When the [AnimationTrack.Speed](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/AnimationTrack/Speed) of an `AnimationTrack` is equal to 1, the animation will take [AnimationTrack.Length](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/AnimationTrack/Length) (in seconds) to complete.
