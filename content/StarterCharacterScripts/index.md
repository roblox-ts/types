The StarterCharacterScripts class stores scripts to be parented in a player's [Character](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/Character), when they spawn.

Unlike scripts stored in the [PlayerScripts](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/PlayerScripts) folder, these scripts will not persist when the player respawns.

If a script named **Animate**, **Sound** or **Health** is placed in this folder, they will replace the default scripts that are added to each [Character](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/Character) that is created.
