An internal object used by networking and replication code to transmit [BasePart.Touched](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/BasePart/Touched) and [BasePart.TouchEnded](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/BasePart/TouchEnded) events.

The TouchTransmitter object named 'TouchInterest' is created and parented to a `BasePart` when the [BasePart.Touched](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/BasePart/Touched) or [BasePart.TouchEnded](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/BasePart/TouchEnded) events are listened (connected) to.

Removing the TouchTransmitter will prevent the touched events from working. The TouchTransmitter object can also be removed exclusively on the client (when [Workspace.FilteringEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Workspace/FilteringEnabled) is set to true). This will prevent collisions from models the client has network ownership of (such as the player's character) from registering.

Note, in almost all circumstances developers should disconnect the connection using [RBXScriptConnection.Disconnect](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Disconnect) method rather than removing the TouchTransmitter. Otherwise the connection will not be cleaned up which can cause performance issues over time.
