The EqualizerSoundEffect allows for control of the volume of various frequency ranges for the Sound or SoundGroup the effect is applied to. This can be used to highlight particular elements of audio or minimize or outright eliminate others.

The EqualizerSoundEffect gives control over three ranges of frequency: Low, Mid, and High, and their specific frequencies are as follows:

* Low: 0 - 400 Hz

* Mid: 400 - 4000 Hz

* High: 4000+ HzLike all other `SoundEffect`, a EqualizerSoundEffect can be applied either to a `Sound` or `SoundGroup` by being parented to either.
