The Sky object is an object, when placed inside `Lighting`, will change the appearance of the game's sky. This allows for a custom sky to be used as opposed to the Roblox default sky. The Skybox is composed of six sides, much like that of a cube. If the skybox is changed/customised, the Sun and other objects in the sky will remain visible, unless you turn off the Sky object's [Sky.CelestialBodiesShown](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sky/CelestialBodiesShown) property, which will remove the Sun, Moon, and stars from the sky. The recommended picture dimensions for a Skybox side are 256x256 pixels. By adjusting the [Sky.StarCount](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Sky/StarCount) property of the Sky object, you can change how many stars will appear in the sky at night.
