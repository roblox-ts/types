The **Enabled** property of a `WeldConstraint` sets whether the constraint is active or not. When this property is set to true, if the constraint’s [WeldConstraint.Part0](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/WeldConstraint/Part0) and [WeldConstraint.Part1](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/WeldConstraint/Part1) properties are set, then the constraint will ensure that its two connected parts will be locked together.
