FillEmptySpaceColumns determines whether cells' X size are set such that the entire horizontal space of the parent UI element is used. Enabling this is useful for making sure your table takes up a more easily predictable amount of horizontal space (the X-axis size of the parent UI element). It is still possible that a `UISizeConstraint` applied to cells will cause underflow/overflow.

When enabling this property, the column widths will be approximately equal to the parent's [GuiBase2d.AbsoluteSize](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/GuiBase2d/AbsoluteSize).X component divided by the number of columns (not accounting for padding or other factors).
