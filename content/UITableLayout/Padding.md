Padding will position elements with extra space between them. This can be done using Scale or Offset components of UDim2. Negative values can bring elements closer together. When non-zero, the sibling UI elements may be visible between the cells contained within them. In the image below, you can see the padding of 5 pixels applied between the cells (and the sibling UI elements acting as rows in yellow).
