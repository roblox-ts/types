TextXAlignment determines the horizontal alignment (X-axis) of text rendered within a UI element's space. It functions similarly to the CSS text-align property, with left, right and center values (there is no justify option). For Left and Right, text is rendered such that the left/right text bounds just touch the edge of the UI element rectangle. For Center, each line of text is centered on the very center of the UI element rectangle.

This property is used in conjunction with [TextBox.TextYAlignment](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/TextBox/TextYAlignment) to fully determine text alignment on both axes. This property won't affect the read-only properties [TextBox.TextBounds](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/TextBox/TextBounds) and [TextBox.TextFits](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/TextBox/TextFits).
