The Font property selects one of several pre-defined [fonts](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=Font) with which the UI element will render its text. Some fonts have bold, italic and/or light variants (as there is no font-weight or font-style properties).

With the exception of the "Legacy" font, each font will render text with the line height equal to the [TextBox.TextSize](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/TextBox/TextSize) property. The "Code" font is the only monospace font. It has the unique property that each character has the exact same width and height ratio of 1:2. The width of each character is approximately half the [TextBox.TextSize](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/TextBox/TextSize) property.
