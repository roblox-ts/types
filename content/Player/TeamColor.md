The TeamColor property determines which team a Player is associated with according to that Team's [Team.TeamColor](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Team/TeamColor). Changing this property will change [Player.Team](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/Team) according to whichever team has the same [DataType.BrickColor](https://developer.roblox.com/search#stq=BrickColor) for their [Team.TeamColor](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Team/TeamColor). If no Team object has the associated TeamColor, the player will not be associated with a team.

It's often a better idea to set [Player.Team](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/Team) to the respective `Team` instead of using this property. Setting this property often leads to repetition of the same BrickColor value for a certain teams across many scripts; this is something you want to avoid when adhering to the [don't-repeat-yourself][1] principle.
