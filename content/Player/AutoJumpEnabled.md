The AutoJumpEnabled property determines whether the [Player.Character](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/Character) of a `Player` using a mobile device will automatically jump when they hit an obstacle. This can make levels more navigable while on a mobile device.

When the player joins the game, the [StarterPlayer.AutoJumpEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/StarterPlayer/AutoJumpEnabled) value determines the initial state of this property. Then, this property determines the value of the [Humanoid.AutoJumpEnabled](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Humanoid/AutoJumpEnabled) property of the [Player.Character](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/Character)s `Humanoid` on spawn. In other words, it is possible to set the auto-jump behavior on a per-character, per-player and per-game basis using these three properties.
