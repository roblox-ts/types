The AccountAge is a `Player` property that describes how long ago a player's account was registered in days. It is set using the [Player.SetAccountAge](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Player/SetAccountAge) function, which cannot be accessed by scripts.

This property is useful for conditionally showing new Roblox players content such as tutorials.
