The CharacterAdded event fires when a player's character spawns (or respawns). This event fires soon after setting [Player.Character](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Player/Character) to a non-nil value or calling [Player.LoadCharacter](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/function/Player/LoadCharacter). Note, CharacterAdded fires when the Character is assigned to the `Player`, which is before the Character is parented to the `Workspace`.

This can be used alongside the [Player.CharacterRemoving](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Player/CharacterRemoving) event, which fires right before a player's character is about to be removed, typically after death. As such, both of these event can potentially fire many times as players die then respawn in a place. If you want to detect when a player joins or leaves the game, you can use the [Players.PlayerAdded](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Players/PlayerAdded) and [Players.PlayerRemoving](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Players/PlayerRemoving) events instead.

Note that the `Humanoid` and its body parts (head, torso and limbs) will exist when this event fires, but clothing items like [Hats](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Hat) and [Shirts](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/class/Shirt), `Pants` may take a few seconds to be added to the character (connect [Instance.ChildAdded](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/event/Instance/ChildAdded) on the added character to detect these).
