The width in studs of the `Beam` at its end.

The beam will be [Beam.Width0](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/Width0) studs wide at [Beam.Attachment0](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/Attachment0) and the width will change linearly to Width1 studs at [Beam.Attachment1](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/Attachment1). For a visual demonstration of this, see the image below.

![Width][1]

The width properties should not be confused with [Beam.CurveSize0](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/CurveSize0) and [Beam.CurveSize1](https://developer.roblox.com/api-reference/property/Beam/CurveSize1) which control the curvature of the beam.
