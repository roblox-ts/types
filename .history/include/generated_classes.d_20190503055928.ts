// GENERATED ROBLOX INSTANCE CLASSES

interface RbxInternalInstance {
	/** Determines if an `Instance` can be cloned using `/Instance/Clone` or saved to file.

This property determines whether an object should be included when the game is published or saved, or when `Instance/Clone` is called on one of the objects ancestors. Calling Clone directly on an object will return nil if the cloned object is not archivable. Copying an object in Studio (using the ‘Duplicate’ or ‘Copy’ options) will ignore the Archivable property and set Archivable to true for the copy.

```lua
local part = Instance.new("Part")
print(part:Clone()) --&gt; Part
part.Archivable = false
print(part:Clone()) --&gt; nil
``` */
	Archivable: boolean;
	/** A non-unique identifier of the `Instance`.

This property is an identifier that describes an object. Names are not necessarily unique identifiers however; multiple children of an object may share the same name. Names are used to keep the object hierarchy organized, along with allowing scripts to access specific objects.

The name of an object is often used to access the object through the data model hierarchy using the following methods:

```lua
local baseplate = workspace.Baseplate
local baseplate = workspace["Baseplate"]
local baseplate = workspace:FindFirstChild("BasePlate")
```

In order to make an object accessible using the dot operator, an object’s Name must follow a certain syntax. The objects name must start with an underscore or letter. The rest of the name can only contain letters, numbers, or underscores (no other special characters). If an objects name does not follow this syntax it will not be accessible using the dot operator and Lua will not interpret its name as an identifier.

If more than one object with the same name are siblings then any attempt to index an object by that name will return the only one of the objects found similar to `Instance/FindFirstChild`, but not always the desired object. If a specific object needs to be accessed through code, it is recommended to give it a unique name, or guarantee that none of its siblings share the same name as it.

Note, a full name showing the instance’s hierarchy can be obtained using `Instance/GetFullName`. */
	Name: string;
	/** The Parent property determines the hierarchical parent of the `Instance`. The following terminology is commonly used when talking about how this property is set:

- An object is a **child** (**parented to**) another object when its Parent is set to that object.
- The **descendants** of an `Instance` are the children of that object, plus the descendants of the children as well.
- The **ancestors** of an `Instance` are all the objects that the Instance is a descendant of.

It is from this property that many other API members get their name, such as `Instance/GetChildren|GetChildren` and `Instance/FindFirstChild|FindFirstChild`.

The `Instance/Remove|Remove` function sets this property to nil. Calling `Instance/Destroy|Destroy` will set the Parent of an `Instance` and all of its descendants to `nil`, and also **lock** the Parent property. An error is raised when setting the Parent of a destroyed object.

This property is also used to manage whether an object exists in the game or needs be be removed. As long as an objects parent is in the `DataModel`, is stored in a variable, or is referenced by another objects property, then the object remains in the game. Otherwise, the object will automatically be removed. The top level `DataModel` object (the one referred to as the `game` by scripts) has no parent, but always has a reference held to it by the game engine, and exists for the duration of a session.

Newly created objects using `Instance.new` will not have a parent, and usually will not be visible or function until one is set. The most elementary creation of an object has two steps: creating the object, then setting its parent.

```lua
-- Create a part and parent it to the workspace
local part = Instance.new("Part")
part.Parent = workspace
-- Instance new can also take Parent as a second parameter
Instance.new("NumberValue", workspace)
```

### Object Replication

An object created by server will not replicate to clients until it is parented to some object that is replicated. When creating an object then setting many properties, it’s recommended to **set Parent last**. This ensures the object replicates once, instead of replicating many property changes.

```lua
local part = Instance.new("Part") -- Avoid using the second parameter here
part.Anchored = true
part.BrickColor = BrickColor.new("Really red")
-- Potentially many other property changes could go here here...
-- Always set parent last!
part.Parent = workspace
```

However, if you were parenting your parts to a `Model` whose parent hasn’t been set yet, then setting the parent first would not matter as the model would not have replicated yet. */
	Parent?: Instance;
	/** Fires when the `Instance/Parent` property of the object or one of its ancestors is changed.

This event includes two parameters, *child* and *parent*. *Child* refers to the `Instance` whose `Instance/Parent` was actually changed. *Parent* refers to this `Instance`'s new `Instance/Parent`.

A common use for this function is detecting when an object has been removed or destroyed (using `Instance/Destroy`). This is done by checking if the parent has been set to nil. For example:

```lua
object.AncestryChanged:Connect(function(_, parent)
	if not parent then
		print("object destroyed!")
	end
end)
``` */
	readonly AncestryChanged: RBXScriptSignal<(child: Instance, parent: Instance) => void>;
	/** If you want to detect changes of a single property only, you should use `Instance/GetPropertyChangedSignal` instead!

The Changed event fires right after most properties change on objects. It is possible to find the present value of a changed property by using `object[property]`. To get the value of a property before it changes, you must have stored the value of the property before it changed.

If you are only interested in listening to the change of a specific property, consider using the `GetPropertyChangedSignal` method instead to get an event that only fires when a given property changes.

This event does not fire for physics-related changes, like when the `CFrame`, `Velocity`, `RotVelocity`, `Position`, `Orientation` and `CFrame` properties of a `BasePart` change due to gravity. To detect changes in these properties, consider using a physics-based event like `RunService.Stepped` or `BasePart.Touched`. A while-true-do loop can also work.

For “-Value” objects, this event behaves differently: it only fires when the `Value` property changes. See individual pages for `IntValue`, `StringValue`, etc for more information. To detect other changes in these objects, you must use `GetPropertyChangedSignal` instead. */
	readonly Changed: RBXScriptSignal<(property: string) => void>;
	/** Fires when an object is parented to this `Instance`.

Note, when using this function on a client to detect objects created by the server it is necessary to use `Instance/WaitForChild` when indexing these object’s descendants. This is because the object and its descendants are not guaranteed to replicate from the server to the client simultaneously. For example:

```lua
workspace.ChildAdded:Connect(function(child)
	-- need to use WaitForChild as descendants may not have replicated yet
	local head = child:WaitForChild("Head")
end)
```

Note, this function only works for immediate children of the `Instance`. For a function that captures all descendants, use `Instance/DescendantAdded`.

See also, `Instance/ChildRemoved`. */
	readonly ChildAdded: RBXScriptSignal<(child: Instance) => void>;
	/** Fires when a child is removed from this `Instance`.

Removed refers to when an object’s parent is changed from this `Instance` to something other than this `Instance`. Note, this event will also fire when a child is destroyed (using `Instance/Destroy`) as the destroy function sets an object’s parent to nil.

This function only works for immediate children of the `Instance`. For a function that captures all descendants, use `Instance/DescendantRemoved`.

See also `Instance/ChildAdded`. */
	readonly ChildRemoved: RBXScriptSignal<(child: Instance) => void>;
	/** Fires when a descendant is added to the `Instance`.

As DescendantAdded fires for every descendant, parenting an object to the `Instance` will fire the event for this object and all of its descendants individually.

Developers only concerned with the immediate children of the `Instance` should use `Instance/ChildAdded` instead.

See also `Instance/DescendantRemoving`. */
	readonly DescendantAdded: RBXScriptSignal<(descendant: Instance) => void>;
	/** DescendantRemoving fires **immediately before** the `Instance/Parent|Parent` of a descendant of the `Instance` changes such that the object is no longer a descendant of the Instance. `Instance/Destroy|Destroy` and `Instance/Remove|Remove` change an object’s Parent to nil, so calling these on a descendant of an object will therefore cause this event to fire.

Since this event fires before the the descendant’s removal, the Parent of the descendant will be unchanged, i.e., it will still be a descendant at the time of this event firing. If the descendant is also a child of the object, It will also fire before ChildRemoved. There is no similar event called “DescendantRemoved”.

If a descendant has children, this event fires with the descendant first followed by its descendants.

### Example

The example below should help clarify how DescendantRemoving fires when there are several objects involved.

![A cropped screenshot of the Explorer window. A Model contains ModelA and ModelB, which each contain a Part, PartA and PartB respectively. PartA contains a Fire object named FireA.](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5bedf8a8a79094cd2b6a1c41/DescendantRemoving2.png)

- Calling `Instance/Remove|Remove` on **PartA** would cause DescendantRemoving to fire on both **ModelA** and **Model**, in that order.
- Setting the `Instance/Parent|Parent` of **PartA** to **ModelB** would cause DescendantRemoving to fire on **ModelA** but not **Model** (as Model would still be an ancestor of PartA).
- Calling `Instance/Destroy|Destroy` on **ModelA** would cause DescendantRemoving to fire multiple times on several objects: 1. On **Model** with **ModelA**, **PartA** then **FireA**.
    2. On **ModelA**, with **PartA** then **FireA**.
    3. On **PartA** with **FireA**.

### Warning

This event fires with the descendant object that is being removed. Attempting to set the `Instance/Parent|Parent` of the descendant being removed to something else **will fail** with the following warning: “Something unexpectedly tried to set the parent of X to Y while trying to set the parent of X. Current parent is Z”, where X is the removing descendant, Y is the ignored parent setting, and Z is the original parent of X. Below is an example that demonstrates this:

```lua
workspace.DescendantRemoving:Connect(function(descendant)
	-- Don't manipulate the parent of descendant in this function!
	-- This event fires BECAUSE the parent of descendant was manipulated,
	-- and the change hasn't happened yet, i.e. this function fires before that happens.
	-- Therefore, it is problematic to change the parent like this:
	descendant.Parent = game
end)
local part = Instance.new("Part")
part.Parent = workspace
part.Parent = nil -- This triggers DescendantRemoving on Workspace:
--&gt; Something unexpectedly tried to set the parent of Part to NULL while trying to set the parent of Part. Current parent is Workspace.
```

See also `Instance/DescendantAdded|DescendantAdded`. */
	readonly DescendantRemoving: RBXScriptSignal<(descendant: Instance) => void>;
	/** This function destroys all of an `Instance`'s children.

As `Instance/Destroy` also calls itself on the children of an object it is used on, this function will destroy all descendants.

### Alternatives to ClearAllChildren

If the developer does not wish to destroy all descendants, they should use `Instance/GetChildren` or `Instance/GetDescendants` to loop through an object and select what to destroy. For example, the following code sample will destroy all parts in an object.

```lua
for _, instance in pairs(object:GetDescendants()) do
	if instance:IsA("BasePart") then
		instance:Destroy()
	end
end
``` */
	ClearAllChildren(): void;
	/** Create a deep copy of a Roblox Instance and all of its descendants, with all the same property values. Returns a new, separate object whose Parent property is `nil`. The next step after cloning an object is setting the Parent, and optionally re-positioning the new object if it has 3d geometry.

Any references to objects not in the cloned hierarchy are maintained (i.e. if an ObjectValue refers to an external object it will refer to the same external object). Any internal references are relative (ie if an ObjectValue refers to an internal object it will refer to a similar internal object in the copy).

Any objects in the cloned object’s hierarchy (including the object itself) that does not have the `Archivable` property enabled are ignored. If the root object is not Archivable, the function returns `nil`.

Clone is useful for regenerating models by saving the original and spawning copies. It’s also useful for taking a snapshot of the current state of a model if it is changing over time. */
	Clone(): this;
	/** Sets the `Instance/Parent` property to nil, locks the `Instance/Parent` property, disconnects all connections and calls Destroy on all children. This function is the correct way to dispose of objects that are no longer required. Disposing of unneeded objects is important, since unnecessary objects and connections in a place use up memory (this is called a **memory leak**) which can lead to serious performance issues over time.

Tip: After calling Destroy on an object, set any variables referencing the object (or its descendants) to nil. This prevents your code from accessing anything to do with the object.

Once an `Instance` has been destroyed by this method it cannot be reused because the `Instance/Parent` property is locked. To temporarily remove an object, set `Instance/Parent|Parent` it to nil instead. For example:

```lua
object.Parent = nil
wait(2)
object.Parent = workspace
```

To Destroy an object after a set amount of time, use `Debris/AddItem`. */
	Destroy(): void;
	/** Returns the first ancestor of the `Instance` whose `Instance/Name` is equal to the given name.

This function works upwards, meaning it starts at the `Instance`'s immediate `Instance/Parent` and works up towards the `DataModel`. If no matching ancestor is found, it returns nil.

The following code snippet would find the first ancestor of the object named ‘Car’.

If the optional recursive argument is true, this function searches all descendants rather than only the immediate children of the `Instance`. Use this function if your code cannot guarantee the existence of an object with a given name.

### Checking the Existence of An Object

FindFirstChild is necessary if you need to verify an object something exists before continuing. Attempting to index a child by name using the dot operator throws an error if the child doesn’t exist.

```lua
-- The following line errors if Part doesn't exist in the Workspace:
workspace.Part.Transparency = .5
```

Use FindFirstChild to first check for Part, then use an if-statement to run code that needs it.

```lua
local part = workspace:FindFirstChild("Part")
if part then
	part.Transparency = .5
end
```

### Finding a Child Whose Name Matches a Property

Sometimes the `Instance/Name|Name` of an object is the same as that of a property of its `Instance/Parent|Parent`. When using the dot operator, properties take precedence over children if they share a name.

In the following example, a `Folder` called “Color” is added to a `Part`, which also has the `Part/Color` property. `Part.Color` refers to the `datatype/Color3`, not the Folder.

```lua
local part = Instance.new("Part")
local folder = Instance.new("Folder")
folder.Name = "Color"
folder.Parent = part
local c = part.Color --> A Color3
local c2 = part:FindFirstChild("Color") --> The Folder
```

A benefit of using FindFirstChild in this way is that the introduction of new properties does not impose a risk on your code.

Tip: If you only need to use the result of a FindFirstChild call once, such as getting the property of a child if it exists, you can use the following syntax with the and operator:If SomePart exists, myColor will contain the Color of SomePart. Otherwise, it’ll be nil without throwing an error. This works due to short-circuiting: Lua ignores the right side if the left is nil/false

### Performance Note

FindFirstChild takes about 20% longer than using dot operator, and almost 8 times longer than simply storing a reference to an object. Therefore, you should avoid calling FindFirstChild in performance dependent code, such as in tight loops or functions connected to `RunService/Heartbeat`/`RunService/RenderStepped`. **Store the result in a variable,** or consider using `Instance/ChildAdded|ChildAdded` or `Instance/WaitForChild|WaitForChild` to detect when a child of a given name becomes available. */

Unlike `Instance/GetChildren`, which only returns the immediate children of an object, GetDescendants will find every child of the object, every child of those children, and so on and so forth.

The arrays returned by GetDescendants are arranged so that parents come earlier than their children. For example, let’s look at the following setup:

![Workspace Descendants](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5c5622a2005d89b20bb84fee/GetDescendantsExample.png)

Here we have a `Model` in the `Workspace`. Inside this model is three parts (C, D, and E) and another model (InnerModel). Inside the inner model are two more parts (A and B). If we use GetDescendants on the first model and print out the contents of the returned array, we can see that the first level of children, InnerModel, C, D, and E, are printed out before A and B.

```lua
local descendants = game.Workspace.Model:GetDescendants()

-- Loop through all of the descendants of the model and
-- print out their name
for index, descendant in pairs(descendants) do
	print(descendant.Name)
end

When called on an `Instance` that is not a descendant of the `DataModel`, this function considers all ancestors up to and including the topmost one without a `Instance/Parent|Parent`.

This function is useful for logging and debugging. You shouldn’t attempt to parse the returned string for any useful operation; this function does not escape periods (or any other symbol) in object names.

`ValueBase` objects, such as `IntValue` and `StringValue`, use a modified `Changed` event that fires with the contents of the `Value` property. As such, this method provides a way to detect changes in other properties of those objects. For example, to detect changes in the `Name` property of an `IntValue`, use `IntValue:GetPropertyChangedSignal("Name"):Connect(someFunc)` since the `Changed` event of `IntValue` objects only detect changes on the `Value` property. */

```lua
local function paintFigure(character, color)
	-- Iterate over the child objects of the character
	for _, child in pairs(character:GetChildren()) do
		-- Filter out non-part objects, such as Shirt, Pants and Humanoid
		-- R15 use MeshPart and R6 use Part, so we use BasePart here to detect both:
		if child:IsA("BasePart") then
			child.BrickColor = color
		end
	end
end
paintFigure(game.Players.Player.Character, BrickColor.new("Bright blue"))

If the *timeOut* parameter is specified, this function will return nil and time out after *timeOut* seconds elapsing without the child being found.

### Where should I use WaitForChild?

WaitForChild is extremely important when working on code ran by the client. Roblox does not guarantee the time or order in which objects are replicated from the server to the client. This can cause scripts to break when indexing objects that do not exist yet.

For example, a `LocalScript` may access a `Model` in the `Workspace` called ‘Ship’ like so:

```lua
local ship = workspace.Ship
-- Will error if ship hasn't replicated
```

However if the model ‘Ship’ has not replicated to the client when this code is ran an error will be returned breaking the `LocalScript`.

Another alternative is using `Instance/FindFirstChild`. Not only is this good practice when indexing objects in the `DataModel` (as it avoids accidentally accessing properties) but it does not break if the object does not exist. For example:

```lua
local ship = workspace:FindFirstChild("Ship")
-- Won't error, but ship will be nil if the ship hasn't replicated
```

Here, if the model doesn’t exist the code will not error. Instead the value ship will be equal to nil. This is better, but still not much good if we want to use the ship model.

Instead WaitForChild should be used:

```lua
local ship = workspace:WaitForChild("Ship")
-- Will wait until the ship has replicated before continuing
```

Here, the thread will be yielded until the ship model has been found. This means the ship model can be used as soon as it is ready.

### Notes

- If a call to this function exceeds 5 seconds without returning, and no *timeOut* parameter has been specified, a warning will be printed to the output that the thread may yield indefinitely
- This function will return immediately without yielding if the child exists when the call is made
- WaitForChild is less efficient than `Instance/FindFirstChild` or the dot operator. Therefore it should only be used when the developer is not sure if the object has replicated to the client. Generally this is only the first time the object is accessed */

/** This AdService class was historically a service used to display mobile video ads as a form of game monetization. It has been decommissioned and is no longer operational.

![iPad displaying an ad](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5c3e6293ae0aa2bf7f3a52fe/AdserviceIPad.png)It allowed game creators to utilize a the service and display video ads to mobile players on supported iOS and Android devices. Players were able to view up to 5 ads per hour across the site.

### Best Practices

- You couldn’t play an ad more than five times in an hour, in any mobile instance.
- `GuiObject|GUIs` were extremely important in getting your ads out. They made sure players knew they were seeing an ad and that gameplay would begin once it was over. Particularly something that said, “and now a word from our sponsor,” or “gameplay sponsored by…”
- You had to make sure players inside your game didn’t take damage or get knocked out while they were watching an ad (this could be as simple as giving them a forcefield while the ad plays).
- It was important to always show ads when it didn’t interfere with gameplay (like between rounds, before the game starts, or after a player gets knocked out).

### Benefits

Implementing video ad impressions in mobile gameplay sessions offers a variety of positive things for Roblox developers.

The more hits your ad got, the more ROBUX you earned (at a rate of one ROBUX per 20 impressions). So if you were trying to utilize the heavy traffic you received in your game, it was recommended to using the API to call the commercial before your game started. For those who already had a hit game, this this could have functioned as supplemental income.

Thinking of the bigger picture. You could tie the API call to, say, a button inside your game, which would only play the ad when pressed. Many Roblox players wanted to earn exclusive items for your game, but maybe couldn’t afford them. Perhaps you could tie one of those items into the ad — couldn’t afford the Green Balloon? Here was another option: watch a 30 second ad. The player got the item, you got the impression, and the cycle continued that way. Maybe your game was round-based. Why not play an ad between rounds? That was easily 20 impressions just while waiting for the next level to load. And more ad impressions meant more ROBUX in your pocket. */

### How to load an Animation

The following code can be used to load an `Animation` onto an `AnimationController`.

```lua
local animationTrack = animationController:LoadAnimation(animation)
animationTrack:Play()
```

### Should I load an Animation on the client or server?

In order for `AnimationTrack`s to replicate correctly, it’s important to know when they should be loaded on the client (via a `LocalScript`) or on the server (via a `Script`). If an `AnimationController` is created on the server, its animations should be loaded and played on the server unless a player has been assigned network ownership of the `Model`'s root part using `BasePart/SetNetworkOwner`.

Roblox provides an interface for a player to access their backpack and inventory by default at the bottom of the screen. If a developer wishes to disable the default Roblox backpack GUI and replace it with their own, they may do so using `StarterGui/SetCoreGuiEnabled`.

The Backpack can be accessed from both the client and the server.

### Usage

By default, this property is set to *‘LandscapeSensor’*, meaning the viewport will rotate so it is always right-side-up in landscape.

Changing this property will not change the `Enum/ScreenOrientation` for `Player|Players` already in the game. To change the orientation for an existing player use their `PlayerGui/ScreenOrientation` property.

You can also get the current screen orientation for a user’s device using `PlayerGui/CurrentScreenOrientation`. This is useful when using the ‘sensor’ `Enum/ScreenOrientation` settings.

	for _,name in pairs(names) do
		local signal = Instance.new(bindableClass)
		signal.Name = targetName .. "_" .. name
		signal.Parent = script
		target[name] = signal
	end
end

	"VisibilityStateChanged",
		-- ^ Fire this with 'true' when the user shows or hides the chat.

	"MessagesChanged",
		-- ^ Fire this with a number to change the number of messages that have been recorded by the chat window.
		--   If the CoreGui thinks the chat window isn't visible, it will display the recorded difference between
		--   the number of messages that was displayed when it was visible, and the number you supply.

	"MessagePosted"
		-- ^ Fire this to make the player directly chat under Roblox's C++ API.
		--	 This will fire the LocalPlayer's Chatted event.
		--   Please only fire this on the player's behalf. If you attempt to spoof a player's chat
		--   to get them in trouble, you could face serious moderation action.

/** A Beam object connects two `Attachment`s by drawing a texture between them.

### Setting up a Beam

To display, beams must be a descendant of the `Workspace` with their `Beam/Attachment0` and `Beam/Attachment1` properties set to `Attachment`s also descending from the `Workspace`.

The beam’s appearance can be customised using the range of properties available.

### Beam Curvature

Beams are configured to use a cubic [Bézier curve](). This means they are not constrained to straight lines, and the curve of the beam can be modified by changing `Beam/CurveSize0`, `Beam/CurveSize1` and the orientation of the beam’s `Attachment`s.

Cubic Bézier curves are formed of four control points. They are determined as follows:

- **P0**: The start of the beam, the position of `Beam/Attachment0`
- **P1**: `Beam/CurveSize0` studs away from `Beam/Attachment0`, in `Beam/Attachment0`'s positive X direction.
- **P2**: `Beam/CurveSize1` studs away from `Beam/Attachment1`, in `Beam/Attachment1`'s negative X direction.
- **P3**: The end of the beam, the position of `Beam/Attachment1`

The beam starts at P0, goes towards P1, and arrives at P3, from the direction of P2. The beam will not necessarily pass through P1 and P2.

See the image below for a visual demonstration.

![Beam Curve](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b440a3b46591e820b82a430/BeamCurve1.png) */
interface Beam extends RbxInternalInstance {
	/** The string name of this Instance's most derived class. */
	readonly ClassName: "Beam";
	/** The `Attachment` the `Beam` originates from.

A `Beam`'s Attachment0 is the first control point on the `Beam`'s [cubic Bézier curve](). The orientation of Attachment0, alongside the `Beam`'s `Beam/CurveSize0`, property determine the position of the second control point.

For the `Attachment` where the `Beam` ends see `Beam/Attachment1`.

For more information how a `Beam` curves, see `Beam/CurveSize0`. */
	Attachment0?: Attachment;
	/** The `Attachment` the `Beam` ends at.

A `Beam`'s Attachment1 is the fourth and final control point on the `Beam`'s [cubic Bézier curve](). The orientation of Attachment1, alongside the `Beam`'s `Beam/CurveSize1` property, determine the position of the third control point.

For the `Attachment` where the `Beam` starts see `Beam/Attachment0`.

For more information how a `Beam` curves, see `Beam/CurveSize1`. */
	Attachment1?: Attachment;
	/** Determines the color of the `Beam`.

If the `Beam`'s `Beam/Texture` is set, this color will be applied to the `Beam`'s texture. If no `Beam/Texture` has been set then the `Beam` will appear as a solid bar colored in accordance with this property.

### Beams and ColorSequences

This property is a `DataType/ColorSequence`, allowing the color to be configured to vary across the length of the `Beam`. Take for example the following `DataType/ColorSequence`.

```lua
local colorSequence = ColorSequence.new({
	ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0, Color3.fromRGB(255, 0, 0)), -- red
	ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(0.5, Color3.fromRGB(0, 255, 0)), -- green
	ColorSequenceKeypoint.new(1, Color3.fromRGB(0, 0, 255)), -- blue
	}
)
```

Applying this `DataType/ColorSequence` to a `Beam` would yield the following result:

![enter image description here](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt44487f7a1e259ab2/BeamColor.png)

Note the `Beam`'s coloration also depends on the number of `Beam/Segments` the `Beam` has. Each segment of the beam can only show a transition between two colors. Therefore a `Beam` will need to have at least n-1 segments in order for the color to display correctly, where n is the number of `DataType/ColorSequenceKeypoint`s in the `DataType/ColorSequence` */
	Color: ColorSequence;
	/** Determines, along with `Beam/Attachment0` the position of the first control point in the Beam’s Bézier curve.

The position of this point can be determined by the following equation:

```lua
local controlPoint1 = Beam.Attachment0.WorldPosition + (Beam.Attachment0.CFrame.rightVector * Beam.CurveSize0)
```

### Beam Curvature

Beams are configured to use a cubic [Bézier curve](). This means they are not constrained to straight lines, and the curve of the beam can be modified by changing CurveSize0, `Beam/CurveSize1` and the orientation of the beam’s `Attachment`s.

Cubic Bézier curves are formed of four control points. They are determined as follows:

- **P0**: The start of the beam, the position of `Beam/Attachment0`
- **P1**: CurveSize0 studs away from `Beam/Attachment0`, in `Beam/Attachment0`'s positive X direction.
- **P2**: `Beam/CurveSize1` studs away from `Beam/Attachment1`, in `Beam/Attachment1`'s negative X direction.
- **P3**: The end of the beam, the position of `Beam/Attachment1`

The beam starts at P0, goes towards P1, and arrives at P3, from the direction of P2. The beam will not necessarily pass through P1 and P2.

See the images below for a visual demonstration.

![BeamCurve1](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b440a3b46591e820b82a430/BeamCurve1.png)

	CurveSize0: number;
	/** Determines, along with `Beam/Attachment0` the position of the first control point in the Beam’s Bézier curve.

The position of this point can be determined by the following equation:

```lua
local controlPoint2 = Beam.Attachment1.WorldPosition - (Beam.Attachment1.CFrame.rightVector * Beam.CurveSize1)
```

Cubic Bézier curves are formed of four control points. They are determined as follows:

- **P0**: The start of the beam, the position of `Beam/Attachment0`
- **P1**: `Beam/CurveSize0` studs away from `Beam/Attachment0`, in `Beam/Attachment0`'s positive X direction.
- **P2**: CurveSize1 studs away from `Beam/Attachment1`, in `Beam/Attachment1`'s negative X direction.
- **P3**: The end of the beam, the position of `Beam/Attachment1`

The beam starts at P0, goes towards P1, and arrives at P3, from the direction of P2. The beam will not necessarily pass through P1 and P2.

See the images below for a visual demonstration.

The LightEmission property determines the blending of the `Beam` with the colors behind it. It should be set in the range [0, 1]. A value of 0 uses normal blending modes, and a value of 1 will use additive blending. The value of the additive blending is determined by this property.

Pictured below are two sets of overlapping `Beam`s. The right one has its LightEmission set to 1, so the texture appears brighter due to the additive blending on the overlaps.

### Beam Segments and curvature

Rather than being a perfect curve, a beam is made up of straight segments. The more segments, the higher the resoloution of the curve. See the image below for a demonstration of this:

![enter image description here][1]

For more information on how a `Beam` is configured to curve, see the page for `Beam/CurveSize0`.

### Beam Segments with Color and Transparency

The `Beam/Color` and `Beam/Transparency` properties require a certain number of segments to display correctly. This is because each segment can only show a transition between two colors or transparencies. Therefore a `Beam` requires at least n-1 segments to display correctly, where n is the number of keypoint associated with the `Beam`'s `Beam/Color` and `Beam/Transparency`.

	/** Sets the length of the `Beam`s texture if `Beam/TextureMode` is ‘Wrap’ or ‘Static’. If `Beam/TextureMode` is ‘Stretch’ then it determines the size of the texture relative to the `Beam`'s length.

### Beam texture behavior

How a `Beam|Beam's` texture scales or repeats is dependent on the `Beam/TextureMode` property.

When `Beam/TextureMode` is ‘Wrap’ the size of the repeating texture is equal to TextureLength in studs. For an example of this see the image below:

When `Beam/TextureMode` is set to ‘Stretch’ however the texture will be stretched relative to the beam’s length. The size of the texture relative to the `Beam`'s length will be one over the TextureLength. In practice, this means the texture will repeat TextureLength times.

	TextureSpeed: number;
	/** Determines the transparency of the `Beam` across its segments.

### Beams and Transparency

This property is a `DataType/NumberSequence`, allowing the transparency to be configured to vary across the length of the `Beam`. Take for example the following `DataType/NumberSequence`.

```lua
local numberSequence = NumberSequence.new({
	NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0, 1), -- transparent
	NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(0.5, 0), -- opaque
	NumberSequenceKeypoint.new(1, 1), -- transparent

Applying this `DataType/NumberSequence` to a `Beam` would yield the following result:

![enter image description here](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltb919bbb4d83c7ba8/BeamTransparency.png)

Note the `Beam|Beam's` transparency also depends on the number of `Beam/Segments` the `Beam` has. Each segment of the beam can only show a transition between two transparencies.

This property can be particularly useful when using multiple `Beam|Beams` between the same `Attachment`s. Here, ZOffset can be used to layer the `Beam`s and avoid [Z-fighting](). For example:

See the image below for a visual demonstration of ZOffset:

	ZOffset: number;
	/** Sets the current offset of the `Beam`'s texture cycle.

The offset of a `Beam`s texture cycle represents the progress of the `Beam`s texture animation. Hence, a `Beam`'s texture cycle can be reset as follows:

```lua
beam:SetTextureOffset(0)
```

Where manual control is not required over the `Beam`'s texture cycle, `Beam/TextureSpeed` can be used instead to animate the `Beam`. Although, for illustrative purposes, a similar function can be achieved with SetTextureOffset.

```lua
local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")
while true do
	for i = 1, 0, -0.01 do
		RunService.RenderStepped:Wait()
		beam:SetTextureOffset(i)
	end
end
```

### Notes

- The given offset parameter is expected to be a value between 0 and 1, but greater values can still be used
- The texture cycle wraps at 0 and 1, meaning the texture is in the same position when the offset is 0 or at 1
- If the `Beam/Texture` property is not set, this function will do nothing
- Increasing the offset will act in the inverse direction to the `Beam/TextureSpeed` property. Meaning, it will move the texture in the opposite direction to the direction the texture animates when `Beam/TextureSpeed` is more than 0 */

- `BodyPosition`: Exert force to maintain a certain world position
- `BodyVelocity`: Exert force to maintain a certain velocity

### Rotational Force (Torque)

- `BodyThrust`: Exert a force relative to object coordinates, which applies torque if positioned in a certain way
- `BodyGyro`: Exert torque to maintain a certain orientation
- `BodyAngularVelocity`: Exert torque to maintain a certain angular velocity

An exception is the `RocketPropulsion` class, which exerts **both** translational and rotational forces to cause a part to track down another part. */

This allows for the creation of parts that continually rotate. It is the rotational counterpart to a `BodyVelocity`. If you would like to maintain a constant [angular displacement](), use a `BodyGyro` instead.

![An animation of a Part with a BodyAngularVelocity applied; there is a superimposed green line visualizing the AngularVelocity property](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b42688e811ef5800bf7c42f/BodyAngularVelocity.gif)

The `BodyAngularVelocity/AngularVelocity|AngularVelocity` property (visualized above as a green line) controls the goal angular velocity of the applied torque: the direction of the `DataType/Vector3` is the axis which the part rotates around, and the magnitude is the speed in **radians/s**. The `BodyAngularVelocity/MaxTorque|MaxTorque` property controls the maximum amount of torque that can be applied to the object, while the `BodyAngularVelocity/P|P` property controls the amount of [power]() used in applying the torque.

**Tip:** Regarding the `BodyAngularVelocity/AngularVelocity|AngularVelocity` property, you can multiply a `DataType/Vector3` by `math.rad(360)`, or **2π**, in order to convert [angular frequency]() (rotations per second) into the desired [angular velocity]() (radians per second). For example: Setting `BodyAngularVelocity/AngularVelocity|AngularVelocity` to `Vector3.new(0, 1, 0) * math.rad(360)` ≈ `Vector3.new(0, 6.283, 0)` will cause a part to spin around the Y axis once per second.

To better understand how the axis of rotation is determined from this property, imagine that there is an axle running between the part’s position and the part’s position plus this property as a global offset. This axle determines in what orientation the object will spin. The length of the axle determines the angular speed in radians per second. In the animation below, the `Part` contains a `BodyAngularVelocity` and is floating in the air (using a `BodyPosition`). The `BodyAngularVelocity` has the default AngularVelocity of `(0, 2, 0)`, and this vector is visualized with a superimposed green line. It represents the axis of rotation. If we were to make the axle longer, like `(0, 4, 0)`, the part would spin faster.

/** The BodyForce object applies (or exerts) a force on the part to which it is parented. If the magnitude of such a force is great enough, parts can begin to accelerate. See [Newton’s First Law of Motion](). The force is determined by the `BodyForce/Force` property, and is defined on the three world axes.

A BodyForce alone cannot apply a torque (it cannot cause the parent to rotate on its own). To apply a force at a specific point (e.g. to apply torque for angular acceleration) or apply forces relative to the orientation of the part, use a `BodyThrust` instead.

### Forces Relative to Parent

Using the `CFrame:vectorToWorldSpace(Vector3)` method, it is possible to translate a force vector that is relative to the part into the world vector necessary for `BodyForce/Force|Force`. For example, to apply a force to the left an object (no matter which way it’s facing), try:

```lua
magnitude = 100
left = Vector3.new(-1, 0, 0) * magnitude -- You could also use Vector3.FromNormalId(Enum.NormalId.Left)
bodyForce.Force = bodyForce.Parent.CFrame:vectorToWorldSpace(left)
```

You can also use a `BodyThrust` with a `BodyThrust/Location|Location` of `(0, 0, 0)`, then set the `BodyThrust/Force|Force` for the same effect.

### Anti-gravity

BodyForce is commonly used to counteract the effects of `Workspace/Gravity|Gravity` on a per-part basis by simply applying a force in the +Y direction. See the code samples for more information. */

/** The **BodyGyro** object applies a torque (rotational force) on a `BasePart` such that it maintains a constant angular displacement, or orientation. This allows for the creation of parts that point in a certain direction, as if a real gyroscope were acting upon it. Essentially, it’s the rotational counterpart to a `BodyPosition`.

If you would like to maintain a constant angular velocity, use a `BodyAngularVelocity` instead.

The `BodyGyro/CFrame|CFrame` property controls the goal orientation. Only the angular components of the `DataType/CFrame` are used; position will make no difference. `BodyGyro/MaxTorque|MaxTorque` limits the amount of angular force that may be applied, `BodyGyro/P|P` controls the power used in achieving the goal orientation, and `BodyGyro/D|D` controls dampening behavior.

### Setting the Orientation

Like all `DataType/CFrame` properties, the `BodyGyro/CFrame` property isn’t editable in the **Properties** window of Studio. Since there’s no physical component to a **BodyGyro**, you should use scripting to set the `BodyGyro/CFrame`.

A common technique for setting the goal orientation is to set the `BodyGyro/CFrame` to a part’s `BasePart/CFrame|CFrame`. For example:

```lua
workspace.Part.BodyGyro.CFrame = workspace.Part.CFrame
```

You can also use a `DataType/CFrame` **constructor** which initializes rotation such as `CFrame.fromAxisAngle`, `CFrame.fromEulerAnglesXYZ`, or `CFrame.fromEulerAnglesYXZ`. Alternatively, you can use the following structure to make the body gyro “look at” a `targetPosition`.

```lua
CFrame.new(BodyGyro.Parent.Position, targetPosition)
```

### Troubleshooting

- If the assembly isn’t moving at all, it most likely has mass larger than what the **BodyGyro** can move. Try raising the `BodyGyro/MaxTorque|MaxTorque` and/or `BodyGyro/P|P` (power) properties. You should also check that no `BasePart/Anchored|Anchored` parts are within the assembly or in the way of the assembly.
- If the assembly isn’t moving on all axes, double check the axis in question has sufficient `BodyGyro/MaxTorque|MaxTorque`. Alternatively, if the part allows movement on an axis and shouldn’t, be sure the `BodyGyro/MaxTorque|MaxTorque` is non-zero

 on that axis and refine the manner in which you are setting the **BodyGyro**`BodyGyro/CFrame|CFrame`.
- If the assembly is moving too quickly, consider raising the `BodyGyro/D|D` (dampening) property.
- If the assembly is moving too slowly, consider lowering the `BodyGyro/D|D` (dampening) property. Also consider raising the `BodyGyro/MaxTorque|MaxTorque` and/or `BodyGyro/P|P` (power) properties.
- Any assembly containing a part that contains a **BodyGyro** or `BodyPosition` will not be simulated when interacting with a player unless that player is the /articles/Network Ownership|network owner

 of the assembly. */

If you need further control on a force applied to an object, consider using a `BodyForce` or `BodyThrust` instead.

The strength of the force applied by this object is controlled by several factors, namely the distance to the goal position: the force is stronger when farther away from the goal. This is amplified by `BodyPosition/P|P` (power). The present velocity will also dampen the force applied by this object, and this is amplified by `BodyPosition/D|D` (dampening). The resulting force is then capped by `BodyPosition/MaxForce|MaxForce`. Note the force applied on the part to achieve the goal position may vary on a per-axis basis.

### Troubleshooting

- If the assembly isn’t moving, it’s likely the `BodyPosition/MaxForce|MaxForce` is too low. Also check for any `BasePart/Anchored|Anchored` parts within the assembly or in the way of the assembly.
- If the assembly is moving horizontally but not vertically, it’s likely the `BodyPosition/MaxForce|MaxForce` is strong enough to overcome friction but not gravity. Consider raising the **Y** component of `BodyPosition/MaxForce|MaxForce` in order to get the object off the ground.
- If the assembly is **overshooting** the goal position and springing back, it’s likely the `BodyPosition/D|D` (dampening) is too low. Alternatively, the `BodyPosition/MaxForce|MaxForce` and/or `BodyPosition/P|P` may be too high.

/** The RocketPropulsion object applies a force on a part so that it both **follows** and **faces** a target part. It acts like a hybrid of `BodyPosition` and `BodyGyro`. Unlike other `BodyMover`s, a RocketPropulsion must be instructed to begin applying a force: call `RocketPropulsion/Fire|Fire` to start, or call `RocketPropulsion/Abort|Abort` to stop.

Below is an animation of a blue `Part` with a RocketPropulsion. The `RocketPropulsion/Target|Target` is set to a tall red `Part` that is being dragged around in a circle in Studio. Notice how the blue part homes in to the target:

![A blue Part with a RocketPropulsion following a tall red Part that is being dragged around in Studio](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b426347b496a3810b47f2d4/RocketPropulsion.gif)

You can detect when the part reaches its target using the `RocketPropulsion/ReachedTarget|ReachedTarget` event, which fires once the part is within the `RocketPropulsion/TargetRadius|TargetRadius` of the `RocketPropulsion/Target|Target`.

RocketPropulsion has the most physics-related properties out of all the BodyMovers. It is helpful to separate the properties out into categories based on what they control:

- **Goal:** `RocketPropulsion/Target|Target`, `RocketPropulsion/TargetOffset|TargetOffset` and `RocketPropulsion/TargetRadius|TargetRadius`
- **Position (Thrust):**`RocketPropulsion/MaxSpeed|MaxSpeed`, `RocketPropulsion/MaxThrust|MaxThrust`, `RocketPropulsion/ThrustD|ThrustD` and `RocketPropulsion/ThrustP|ThrustP`
- **Rotation (Turn):** \- `RocketPropulsion/CartoonFactor|CartoonFactor`, `RocketPropulsion/MaxTorque|MaxTorque`, `RocketPropulsion/TurnD|TurnD` and `RocketPropulsion/TurnP|TurnP`

Remember, you don’t need to use both the translational and rotational force features of a RocketPropulsion: by setting `RocketPropulsion/MaxThrust|MaxThrust` to 0, you can make a part just face the target **without** having it follow the target around (consider also using a `BodyPosition` in addition). Similarly, by setting `RocketPropulsion/MaxTorque|MaxTorque` to `(0, 0, 0)`, you can have a part simply follow another object without facing it (use a `BodyGyro` if you want the object to maintain a specific orientation). */

/** The Camera object defines a view of the 3D game world. In an instance of the game, each client has its own Camera object associated with it. Camera objects exist only upon the viewer’s client, residing in that user’s local Workspace, and therefore cannot be edited directly from the server. As of the most recent versions of the game, the only way to access a client’s Camera object is through a LocalScript running on that client. Each client’s particular Camera object can be accessed through the [CurrentCamera]( "CurrentCamera") property of its local Workspace, assuming your code is running on that specific client.

A camera’s state is defined in the following way:

The Camera/CFrame property, represents the the position and orientation of the camera.

The Focus property represents the point the camera is looking at. It's important to set this property, as it also represents where the game thinks you are in the world. Certain visuals will be more detailed and will update more frequently, depending on how close they are to the Focus. Roblox's default CameraScript will take care of this for you.

The CameraType property represents what action the game engine should perform on the Camera every frame.

The FieldOfView property, a number, represents the angle the user can see out the sides of the Camera.

An internal roll amount, which can be set by using the SetRoll method. This number (in radians) represents the angle in which the camera is rotated. */
interface Camera extends RbxInternalInstance {
	/** The string name of this Instance's most derived class. */
	readonly ClassName: "Camera";
	/** This property is the `DataType/CFrame` of the `Camera` and definies its position and orientation in the 3D world.

Some transformations, such as the rotation of the head when using VR devices are not reflected in this property. For this reason, developers should use `Camera/GetRenderCFrame` to obtain the ‘true’ `DataType/CFrame` of the `Camera`.

### How to set the Camera’s CFrame

You can move the `Camera` by setting the CFrame property. However, the default [camera scripts]() also set the CFrame property. When manually setting the CFrame property, it may be overwritten by the [camera scripts]() which update every frame. There are two options to address this:

1. Set the `Camera` `Camera/CameraType` to *‘Scriptable’*. When the `Camera` is *‘Scriptable’* the default scripts will not update the CFrame. This method is simplest and recommended in most cases

2. Replace the default [camera scripts]() with an alternative that doesn’t interfere with the developer’s desired implementation. This is only recommended when developers do not need any default `Camera` functionality

### How the Camera CFrame works

Like all `DataType/CFrame|CFrame` data, the `Camera` CFrame represents a position and an orientation.

The most intuitive way to position and orientate the `Camera` is by using the *new*`DataType/CFrame` constructor with the *pos* and *lookAt* parameters, for example:

```lua
local pos = Vector3.new(0, 10, 0)
local lookAt = Vector3.new(10, 0, 0)
local cameraCFrame = CFrame.new(pos, lookAt)
workspace.CurrentCamera.CFrame = cameraCFrame
```

In the above example the `Camera` is positioned at *0, 10, 0* and oriented to be looking towards *10, 0, 0*.

### Animating the Camera CFrame

Although the `Camera` can be placed in the manner demonstrated above, you may want to animate the Camera to smoothly move from one `DataType/CFrame` to another. For this, there are a number of options:

1. Creating a `Tween` using `TweenService` that animates the CFrame property of the `Camera`. See the code sample below for an example of this
2. Setting the `Camera` CFrame every frame with `RunService/BindToRenderStep` and the *lerp*`DataType/CFrame` method */
	CFrame: CFrame;
	/** When using the default [camera scripts](), the CameraSubject property has two roles:

- Defining the object the `Camera` is to follow, in the case of the *‘Follow’*, *‘Attach’*, *‘Track’*, *‘Watch’* and *‘Custom’* `Camera/CameraType|CameraTypes`
- For all `Camera/CameraType|CameraTypes` but *‘Scriptable’*, the object whose position the `Camera|Camera's``Camera/Focus` will be set to

CameraSubject accepts a variety of `Instance|Instances`. The default [camera scripts]() respond differently to different CameraSubject types:

- `Humanoid`: By default the CameraSubject is set to the `Players/LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer's``Humanoid`. The camera scripts will follow the `Humanoid` factoring in the `Humanoid|Humanoid's` current state and `Humanoid/CameraOffset`
- `BasePart`: The camera scripts will follow the position of any `BasePart`, with a vertical offset in the case of `VehicleSeat|VehicleSeats`

You can configure the `Camera` to follow a `Model` by setting the CameraSubject to the model’s `Model/PrimaryPart`.

The CameraSubject cannot be set to *nil*. If it is, it will revert to its previous value.

To restore the CameraSubject to its default value, set it to the `Players/LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer's``Humanoid` like so:

```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local localPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer

local function resetCameraSubject()
	if workspace.CurrentCamera and localPlayer.Character then
		local humanoid = localPlayer.Character:FindFirstChildOfClass("Humanoid")
		if humanoid then
			workspace.CurrentCamera.CameraSubject = humanoid
		end
	end
end
``` */
	CameraSubject: Humanoid | BasePart | undefined;
	/** The default Roblox [camera scripts]() have several built in behaviors. Setting the CameraType of a player’s `Camera` will toggle between these behaviors. Note some CameraType’s require a valid `Camera/CameraSubject` to work correctly.

- Fixed: `Camera` is stationary
- Follow: `Camera` moves with the `Camera/CameraSubject` and rotates to keep the subject in the center of view
- Attach: `Camera` moves with the `Camera/CameraSubject` at a fixed offset and will rotate as the subject rotates
- Track: `Camera` moves with the `Camera/CameraSubject` but does not rotate automatically
- Watch: `Camera` is stationary but will rotate to keep the `Camera/CameraSubject` in the center of view
- Custom: Default
- Scriptable: No default behavior. Used by developers to script custom behavior

The above only applies when you use the default Roblox [camera scripts](). If you write your own camera scripts, you can choose to listen to CameraType and implement your own behaviors or ignore the property entirely.

### Manually controlling the Camera

In some cases you may wish to manually control the `Camera` (for example during a cut-scene). The best way to do this is by setting the CameraType to *‘Scriptable’*. The default [camera scripts]() will not move or update the `Camera` on its own if CameraType is set to *’Scriptable’*. This means you can freely modify the `Camera` using its properties and functions. For more information on positioning and orientating the `Camera` manually see the `Camera/CFrame|Camera.CFrame` page.

If you want complete control over the camera at all times, you may replace the default [camera scripts]() with your own. */

	/** Field of view, often shortened to FOV, is the extent of the observable game world that can be seen on screen at a given moment. The FieldOfView property is clamped between 1 and 120 degrees and defaults at 70. Very low or very high fields of view are not recommended as they can be disorientating to players.

The FieldOfView property sets how many degrees in the vertical direction (y-axis) the camera can view. Uniform scaling is enforced meaning the vertical and horizontal field of view are always related by the [aspect ratio]() of the screen. This means the FieldOfView property also determines the horizontal field of view.

See the images below for an example of how different FieldOfView settings can impact the extent of the perceptive game world. At a FOV of 70, a considerable portion of the game world is visible:

![A demonstration of the default FOV of 70](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b676631f9cd894d3d8ace1f/Fov70.png)

However when the FOV is reduced to 30, although the `Camera|Camera's` `Camera/CFrame` has not changed, a much smaller portion of the game world is rendered:

![A demonstration of a reduced FOV of 30](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b67662a74c0756340c86bfa/Fov30.png)

### Suggested uses for FieldOfView

Changing FOV can produce a variety of effects, such as:

- Reducing FOV to give the impression of magnification (for example when using binoculars)
- Increasing FOV when the player is ‘sprinting’ to give the impression of a lack of control */

For example dynamic lighting from objects such as `PointLight|PointLights` may not render at distances far from the Focus.

The default Roblox [camera scripts]() automatically set the Focus to follow the `Camera/CameraSubject` (usually a `Humanoid`). However, Focus will not be automatically updated in the following cases:

- When the `Camera/CameraType` is set to *‘Scriptable’*
- When the default [camera scripts]() are not being used

In these cases, you should update Focus every frame, using `RunService/BindToRenderStep` function at the *‘Camera’* `Enum/RenderPriority`.

```lua
local UserInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")
local headCFrame = UserInputService:GetUserCFrame(Enum.UserCFrame.Head)
renderCFrame = workspace.CurrentCamera.CFrame * headCFrame

### Disabling HeadLocked

You are recommended not to disable HeadLocked for the following reasons:

- Players may experience motion sickness if an equivalent head tracking solution is not added
- The Roblox engine performs latency optimizations when HeadLocked is true

However in some circumstances you may wish to develop your own head tracking systems. For example, you may want custom camera transformations that restrict or augment the `DataType/CFrame` of the head.

They are also serialized when places are saved. At the moment, tags are not visible within Roblox Studio except with the use of a tag-editing plugin.

The primary use of `CollectionService` is to add flags and/or behaviors to Roblox objects. If you find yourself adding the same script to many different objects, perhaps a script that uses CollectionService would be better. Here are a couple examples:

- In an obstacle course with many bricks that kill players, don’t paste the same script in all your kill bricks! Instead, tag them with “KIllBrick”. Then, have any brick tagged as such kill the player.
- Payers with a VIP game pass could have their `Humanoid` tagged “VIP”, and be allowed through doors that only allow VIPs.
- When creating a freeze-tag game, you could tag frozen players’ `Humanoid` objects with a “Frozen” tag. Then, use a `LocalScript` to listen for the “Frozen” tag and create client-side visual effects to reduce the number of objects replicated from server to client.

When working with collections and tags, it’s a good idea to use an [object-oriented programming style](). In almost all situations, tagged objects have their own identity, state and behavior. The pattern goes like this: when a tag is found (`CollectionService/GetTagged` and `CollectionService/GetInstanceAddedSignal`), create a Lua object with the Roblox instance. When it is removed (`CollectionService/GetInstanceRemovedSignal`), call a cleanup/destroy method within the Lua object. See the code samples for a better idea of how this can be done.

When tags replicate, **all tags on an object replicate at the same time**. Therefore, if you set a tag on an object from the client then add/remove a **different** tag on the same object from the server, the client’s local tags on the object are overwritten. */

/** The Configuration object is a container object that is designed to hold value objects to make values used in `Tool`s or any model using `Script`s more accessible.

### How does the Configuration object work?

The Configuration object is just a container, and does not automatically offer any additional functionality to a `Folder`.

Configurations should hold value objects (`BrickColorValue`, `NumberValue`, `IntValue`, `ObjectValue` etc). These value objects should be read by the `Script` or `LocalScript` associated with the configuration to determine constants such as damage, speed or color.

For example,

```lua
local damage = 10
```

Becomes:

```lua
local configuration = tool:FindFirstChildWhichIsA("Configuration", true)
damage = configuration:FindFirstChild("Damage").Value -- A NumberValue
```

The Configuration object is intended to be placed inside a `BasePart` in a `Model` or `Tool`. It was originally intended to be used with a tool that provided a GUI interface to edit these properties. However it is more common now for developers to edit these values directly in the Roblox Studio properties window.

### Why should I use the Configuration object?

Use of Configurations is optional, but a number of developers chose to use them for the following reasons.

- Variables held in a Configuration can be found quickly and are in a single place
- When sharing your work, others can make changes without needing to modify your code
- Provides a single location for variables read by multiple scripts in more complex games */

This constraint inherits properties from `SlidingBallConstraint` and can be configured to actuate translation, as follows:

- If `SlidingBallConstraint/ActuatorType` is set to `Enum/ActuatorType|Motor`, it will attempt to translate the attachments with the goal of reaching `SlidingBallConstraint/Velocity`.

/** The ContextActionService is a game service that allows a game to bind user input to contextual actions, or actions that are only enabled under some condition or period of time. For example, allowing a player to open a door only while close by. In code, an action is simply a string (the name of the action) used by the service to differentiate between unique actions. The string is provided to BindAction and UnbindAction, among other member functions. If two actions are bound to the same input, the most recent takes priority. When the most recent action is unbound, the one bound before that takes control again.

You can inspect the currently bound actions in the developer console under the “Action Bindings” tab. You’ll also see bindings from the Roblox engine too. This is useful in checking if your actions are binding/unbinding at the correct times, or if some other action is stealing input from your actions. For exmaple, if you are attempting to bind WASD, it may be the case that character movement scripts is binding over those same keys.

ContextActionService is especially useful for supporting keyboard-less players, in which on-screen touch buttons can be used in place of key presses. The buttons will display only when the action is bound, and the position, text and/or images of these buttons can be configured through this service.

It’s better to use ContextActionService’s BindAction than UserInputService’s InputBegan for most cases. For example, if you want to use the `R` key to reload a weapon while it is equipped, the player might type “roblox is fun” in chat or otherwise use the `R` key for something else. The weapon could reload when the player didn’t mean to! If you instead use BindAction and UnbindAction when the weapon is equipped/unequipped, ContextActionService will make sure that `R` key presses trigger the reload action only when it is the most recently bound action. */

### How to use mesh offset

The Offset property changes the relative position the mesh will be rendered at. For example, an offset of 0, 5, 0 will cause the mesh to be displayed 5 studs above the position of the `BasePart`.

The position of the `BasePart` remains unchanged, meaning the physics collision box of the part will remain in the same location. This is demonstrated in the image below where the green outline (a `SelectionBox`) shows the extents of the `BasePart`.

![enter image description here](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltd3942dca6b981850/OffsetAnim.gif)

### Other uses for mesh offset

There are a number of interesting uses for the mesh offset property.

- Offset and `DataModelMesh/Scale` can be animated using `TweenService` relatively inexpensively as the engine does not need to make any physics/collision calculations as the `BasePart` is not moved.
- Changing the relationship between the mesh and its collision extents (determined by the `BasePart`) */
	Offset: Vector3;
	/** The Scale of a mesh determines the size of the mesh relative to its original dimensions.

### How to use mesh scale

The scale property works slightly differently depending on the type of mesh being used. Note the size of the `BasePart` remains unchanged, meaning the physics collision box of the part will remain the same.

- `SpecialMesh` objects with `SpecialMesh/FileType` set to ‘FileMesh’ scale relative to the original dimensions of the mesh when it was uploaded to Roblox
- `BlockMesh` objects or `SpecialMesh` objects with `SpecialMesh/FileType` set to ‘Brick’, ‘Wedge’ or ‘Sphere’ scale uniformly relative to the `BasePart/Size` of their parent
- `CylinderMesh` objects or `SpecialMesh` objects with `SpecialMesh/FileType` set to ‘Cylinder’ scale relative to the `BasePart/Size` of their parent. Uniformly for the cylinders height axis and maintaining a 1:1 ratio for the length and width of the cylinder, using the lowest value.
- `SpecialMesh` objects with `SpecialMesh/FileType` set to ‘Head’ currently scale in a non standard manner. Developers should not rely on this as their are plans to change this behavior
- `SpecialMesh` objects with `SpecialMesh/FileType` set to ‘Torso’ scale in a non standard manner. Developers should not rely on this as their are plans to deprecate this mesh type.

### Mesh scale demonstration

The above behavior can be seen in the following demonstration images.

Linear scaling relative to part size for ‘Brick’, ‘Wedge’ and ‘Sphere’ meshes.

### Other uses for mesh scale

There are a number of interesting uses for the mesh offset property.

- `DataModelMesh/Offset` and Scale can be animated using `TweenService` relatively inexpensively as the engine does not need to make any physics/collision calculations as the `BasePart` is not changed.
- Changing the relationship between the mesh and its collision extents (determined by the `BasePart`) */
	Scale: Vector3;
	/** Changes the hue of the mesh’s texture.

Note this property is only functional when a texture has been applied to the mesh. For this reason it only works with the `SpecialMesh` object as it includes the `SpecialMesh/TextureId` property.

### How to use VertexColor

See below for a visual example of the impact of VertexColor on a mesh’s texture.

![enter image description here](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt554914f560c80848/VertexColor_-_Copy.gif)

Note this property uses the `Vector3` rather than the `Color3` data type. Therefore developers will generally need to convert the `Color3` rgb components to the \`Vector3 xyz components. See below for a brief example.

```lua
local yellow = BrickColor.new("Bright yellow")
local yColor = yellow.Color
local yVector = Vector3.new(yColor.r,yColor.g,yColor.b)
workspace.Baseplate.Mesh.VertexColor = yVector
```

### Alternative to VertexColor

Although VertexColor can be used to make changes to the appearance of a Mesh’s texture much more flexibility is offered by uploading a new texture for the mesh. For more information on textures, see the page for `MeshPart`s. */
	VertexColor: Vector3;

/** The DataModelMesh is an abstract class from which mesh classes descend.

Mesh classes are objects that, when parented to `BasePart`s alter the appearance of the part to that of a predefined mesh. Note, they only alter the appearance of the part and not the physics/collision boundaries of the part. Developers looking to apply a mesh to a part that alters the part’s collision should use `MeshPart`s.

Note the `MeshPart` and `CharacterMesh` classes do not descend from DataModelMesh. */
type DataModelMesh = BevelMesh | FileMesh | SpecialMesh;

interface RbxInternalBevelMesh extends RbxInternalDataModelMesh {}
/** This is an abstract class that `BlockMesh` and `CylinderMesh` inherit from. */
type BevelMesh = BlockMesh | CylinderMesh;

/** The BlockMesh object applies a ‘brick’ mesh to the `BasePart` it is parented to. It behaves identically to a `SpecialMesh` with `SpecialMesh/MeshType` set to ‘brick’.

### What does a BlockMesh do?

A BlockMesh gives the `BasePart` it was applied to a brick shaped mesh. It is identical in appearance to a standard Roblox `Part`.

The dimensions of the mesh will scale linearly in all directions with `BasePart/Size`, this means a part containing a BlockMesh can be resized the same way as any other part.

The additional functionality a BlockMesh brings however, is the ability to set the `DataModelMesh/Scale` and `DataModelMesh/Offset` properties. These allow the position and dimensions of the mesh that is displayed to be changed without changing the `BasePart/Position` or `BasePart/Size` of the `BasePart` the mesh is parented to.

Note as the `BlockMesh` object does not include a texture the `DataModelMesh/VertexColor` property does not do anything. */
interface BlockMesh extends RbxInternalBevelMesh {
	/** The string name of this Instance's most derived class. */
	readonly ClassName: "BlockMesh";
}

/** The CylinderMesh object applies a ‘cylinder’ mesh to the `BasePart` it is parented to.

### What does a CylinderMesh do?

A CylinderMesh gives the `BasePart` it was applied to a cylinder shaped mesh.

The mesh applied gives the same appearance as that due to the `SpecialMesh/MeshType` of a `SpecialMesh` being set to ‘Cylinder’ or `Part/Shape` being set to ‘Cylinder’. However, unlike those two cases, it is orientated so that the height of the cylinder is along the `BasePart`'s Y axis.

The dimensions of the mesh scale relative to the `BasePart/Size` of the `BasePart`. This scale is uniformly along the `BasePart`'s Y axis and maintaining a 1:1 ratio for the part’s X and Z axis, using the lowest value. This means the `BasePart` can be resized normally, but the cross section of the cylinder will always remain a circle and cannot be stretched or compressed.

Note as the CylinderMesh object does not include a texture the `DataModelMesh/VertexColor` property does not do anything.

### Why use a CylinderMesh?

The advantage of using a mesh over setting the `Part/Shape` property of a part to ‘Cylinder’ is that the `DataModelMesh/Scale` and `DataModelMesh/Offset` properties are exposed. These allow the position and dimensions of the mesh that is displayed to be changed without changing the `BasePart/Position` or `BasePart/Size` of the `Part` the mesh is parented to.

The key difference between a CylinderMesh or a `SpecialMesh` with `SpecialMesh/MeshType` set to ‘Cylinder’ is the orientation of the cylinder mesh. With a CylinderMesh, the height of the cylinder is aligned with the height (Y axis) of the part. With a `SpecialMesh` (or `Part` with `Part/Shape` set to ‘Cylinder’), the height of the cylinder is aligned with the X axis. */

### How do I create a mesh?

	MeshId: string;
	/** The TextureId is the content ID of the image that is to be applied to used for the meshes texture. When the TextureId property is set to an empty string, no texture will be applied to the mesh.

### How can I change the texture of a mesh?

Using the TextureId property, the texture of a mesh can be changed without having to reupload the mesh. To do this, a new image will need to be uploaded to Roblox with the desired texture. The original texture image file can be obtained by exporting the mesh using the ‘Export Selection’ option in Roblox Studio. The image file will be saved alongside the exported .obj file.

The new texture can then be re-uploaded to Roblox as a Decal and its content ID can be applied to the mesh using the TextureId property.

### How can I make a textured mesh?

A mesh can only be textured if the mesh has been UV mapped. UV mapping refers to the practice of projecting a texture map onto a mesh. This cannot be done using Roblox Studio and has to be done using an external 3D modelling application such as [Blender](). */
	TextureId: string;
}
/** The FileMesh object applies a textured mesh to a `BasePart` when parented to it. Its properties are inherited by the `SpecialMesh` object.

### What is a FileMesh?

FileMeshes allow user uploaded meshes to be applied to a `BasePart`. The mesh that is applied is dependent on the `FileMesh/MeshId` property. A texture can also be applied to this mesh using `FileMesh/TextureId`.

Although it is not an abstract class, and can be used by developers, all `FileMesh` properties are inherited by the `SpecialMesh` object. A `SpecialMesh` behaves identically to the FileMesh object when its `SpecialMesh/MeshType` is set to ‘FileMesh’. Although both objects are functional, the `SpecialMesh` object is the official supported class.

	/** The string name of this Instance's most derived class. */
	readonly ClassName: "FileMesh";
}

/** The SpecialMesh is an object that allows developers to provide a standard template or user uploaded mesh to a `BasePart`.

### What does a SpecialMesh do?

The SpecialMesh object applies a mesh to a `BasePart` depending on the the `SpecialMesh/MeshType` property. A number of options are available.

- **Brick** \- A block shape, equivalent to a `BlockMesh`
- **Cylinder** \- A cylinder, identical to a `Part` with a `Part/Shape` of ‘Cylinder’
- **FileMesh** \- A user uploaded Mesh, equivalent to `FileMesh` that a texture can be applied to using the `FileMesh/TextureId` property
- **Head** \- A character head shape
- **Sphere** \- A sphere shape, similar to a `Part` with a `Part/Shape` of ‘Ball’ but can be freely resized on all axis
- **Wedge** \- A wedge shape, identical to a `WedgePart`
- **Torso** \- A block with sloped sides, due to be deprecated

Note, each `SpecialMesh/MeshType` will scale differently when using `DataModelMesh/Scale`, for more information on this please see the page on `DataModelMesh/Scale`. The SpecialMesh object also exposes the `DataModelMesh/Offset` property.

It is important to remember that when using a SpecialMesh, only the appearance of a part changes. The collision model of the part remains the same. For example, a character will not be able to walk correctly over a mesh as the mesh geometry is not taken into account.

### SpecialMesh or MeshPart?

There are currently two ways of using a developer created mesh. They are using a SpecialMesh with the `SpecialMesh/FileType` set to ‘FileMesh’, or by using a `MeshPart`. Although, on the whole, the `MeshPart` object has superseded the SpecialMesh there are some differences developers should be aware of.

- `BasePart/Material` displays correctly on the mesh when using a `MeshPart` and not when using a SpecialMesh
- `MeshPart`s include the `MeshPart/CollisionFidelity` property, meaning the collision model of a `MeshPart` can be set to resemble the geometry of the mesh. The SpecialMesh object by contrast, uses the parent `BasePart`s collision model
- The mesh of a `MeshPart` scales on all axis depending on the `BasePart/Size|Size` property of the `MeshPart`, the mesh of a SpecialMesh does not
- The SpecialMesh object includes the `DataModelMesh/Offset|Offset` and `DataModelMesh/Scale|Scale` properties whereas `MeshPart`s do not
- The `FileMesh/MeshId|MeshId` property of a `SpecialMesh` can be changed by a `Script` or `LocalScript` during runtime. The `MeshPart/MeshId|MeshId` property of a `MeshPart` can not.

In most, but not all cases, using a `MeshPart` is more suitable. As `MeshPart`s are a relatively new feature however, developers should expect some of the above behaviour to change.

/** The Debris service allows the developer to schedule the removal of the object without yielding any code, through the usage of the `Debris/AddItem` method.

After the lifetime argument has elapsed (in seconds) the object is removed in the same manner as `Instance/Destroy`.

As Debris is a service it must be created using the `ServiceProvider/GetService` method.

**Why use Debris?**

Beyond creating a bit of a mess, objects that are no longer required can use up system memory and cause the game to run slower over time. For this reason it is always advised to run the `Instance/Destroy` function on objects you no longer need. However in many cases an object may have a specific period of utility after which it needs to be destroyed.

Take the example of projectile that has just been thrown. On first thought, it could be cleaned up using:

```lua
wait(3)
projectile:Destroy()
```

However there are a number of issues with this approach. Firstly, it requires yielding the code with a wait, which is not always desirable. Secondly, before the 3 seconds have elapsed the object may have already been destroyed (for example, if it reached `Workspace/FallenPartsDestroyHeight`). In this case, the code would error as it tries to destroy an item that has already been destroyed. One answer may be:

```lua
delay(3, function()
	if projectile and projectile.Parent then
		projectile:Destroy()
	end
end)
```

This solves the above issues, as it spawns a new thread to prevent the current one from yielding and checks to see if it can be destroyed. However at this point a simple command has already become quite complicated and an unnecessary thread is being created.

This is where Debris comes in, and the following code addresses all of the above issues.

```lua
Debris:AddItem(projectile, 3)
```

Debris does not yield the current thread, does not require a new thread and will not error if the object is already destroyed. For this reason it is the recommended method for cleaning up objects with a fixed lifetime. */

If an explosion is instanced whilst the game is running, it will destroy itself shortly afterwards meaning they do not need to be cleaned up using the `Debris` service.

**Explosion effects**

`Humanoids` are killed by explosions as they break the character `Model`'s neck joint. Parenting a `ForceField` to a model will protect all of its children from Explosions. This means that their joints will not be broken and thus `Humanoid`s will not be killed.

If a developer doesn’t want joints between `BaseParts` to be broken or wants to implement their own formula for damaging `Humanoid`s it is recommended they set `Explosion/DestroyJointRadiusPercent` to 0 and use the `Explosion/Hit` event to handle the result of the explosion.

Explosions can also be configured to damage `Terrain`, creating craters, this behavior is controlled by the `Explosion/ExplosionType` property.

The blast pressure determines the acceleration of parts due to an explosion. It does not determine the degree to which joints are broken.

- To apply GUI elements, the `SurfaceGui` object should be used

When the `BasePart` is resized, the image will repeat. The size of the repeating textures is determined by the `Texture/StudsPerTileU` and `StudsPerTileV` properties.

/** The Fire class is of several particle-emitting classes. Like other particle emitters of its kind, Fire objects emit particles when parented to a `BasePart` (such as a `Part`) or an `Attachment` within such a `BasePart`. Compared to the `ParticleEmitter` class, Fire lacks many different customization properties and special methods, such as `ParticleEmitter/Lifetime` or `ParticleEmitter/Emit`. It is useful to create a quick special effect in a pinch; for more detailed work it is preferable to use a `ParticleEmitter` instead.

![A Fire object emitting particles at a neon part on top of a wooden part](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt614752ba08bb2e7c/Fire.png)

Fire objects do not emit any light on their own. To help create a cohesive environment around a burning object in your world, try adding a `PointLight` with a `PointLight/Color` set to orange. This will make your fire look more realistic.

When `Fire/Enabled` is toggled off, particles emit by this object will continue to render until their lifetime expires. When a Fire object’s `Instance/Parent` is set to nil (and/or `Instance/Destroy`ed), all particles will instantly disappear. If this effect is not desired, try hiding the parent object at a far away position, then removing the Fire after a few seconds using `Debris` to give the last particles a chance to expire. This object does not have a `ParticleEmitter/Clear` method, but it is possible to set the `Instance/Parent` to nil and back to the exact same object for the same effect.

Fire particles are only emit from the center of `BasePart` to which they are parented. The particles are emit toward the top (+Y) direction; however, a negative `Fire/Heat` may be used to emit in the bottom (-Y) direction. Parenting a Fire object to an `Attachment` instead allows customization of the particles’ start position and emission direction.

Fire object consist of two emitters. Each are affected differently by `Fire/Size`, `Fire/Heat`, `Fire/Color` and `Fire/SecondaryColor`. The particles emit from the smaller, secondary emitter have a significantly longer lifetime (and rise farther) than those emit by the primary emitter.

/** A `ForceField` protects a `Humanoid` from taking damage using the `Humanoid/TakeDamage` function, and protects `BasePart`s from having their joints broken due to an `Explosion`.

### ForceField Creation

ForceFields are created when a character spawns on a `SpawnLocation` and the `SpawnLocation/Duration` property is greater than zero.

ForeFields influence the instance they are parented to. When parented to a `Model` they will protect all of the `BasePart`s descending from that model. They may be parented to a `BasePart`, but the part’s joints will only be protected if both the part and the part it is connected to also contain ForceField.

### Forcefields and Joints

When a ForceField is parented to a character `Model` the neck joint will be protected and thus the character can not be killed by `Explosions`. Developers can protect joints from Explosions without the need for a `ForceField` object by setting `Explosion/DestroyJointRadiusPercent` to 0.

**ForceFields and Damage**

ForceFields only protect `Humanoid`s from damage using the `Humanoid/TakeDamage` function. Humanoids can still be damaged by setting `Humanoid/Health` directly. For this reason, it is advised that developers use `Humanoid/TakeDamage`. Bearing in mind of course, that it is still possible to check if a `ForceField` exists before manually setting the humanoid’s health as shown below:

```lua
if not characterModel:FindFirstChildOfClass("ForceField") then
	humanoid.Health = humanoid.Health - 10
end
```

Otherwise, the effect will be emitted from the part named “Torso”. The part must have the same parent as the ForceField, if it does not exist then the effect is emitted at 0, 0, 0.

### Legacy Game Passes

Historically, game passes on Roblox had an *Asset ID* associated with them. Although game passes created with an *Asset ID* still have an *Asset ID*, they now also have a *Game Pass ID*. All new game passes created today **only** have a *Game Pass ID*.

You can retrieve the *Game Pass ID* of any pass through its URL, for example the *Game Pass ID* of the below pass is 1:

```lua
https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/1/myGamePass
```

Whether you are using an *Asset ID* or a *Game Pass ID* determines which API members you can use.

An element’s position can also be set by modifying both its scalar and pixel positions at the same time. For instance, tits position can be set to `({0.25, 100}, {0.25, 100})`.

The scalar size is relative to the scalar size of parent GUI elements, if any. For example, if the GUI’s scalar size is `UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0) and it is not the descendant of a GUI, then it will occupy half of the screen horizontally and vertically. However, if the GUI is the child of a GUI with a scalar size of`UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0), then the GUI’s scalar size will render to be half the scalar size of its parent both horizontally and vertically and will occupy a quarter of the screen in both dimensions.

The pixel portions of the `UDim2` value are the same regardless of the parent GUI’s size. The values represent the size of the object in pixels. For example, if Position is set to `{0, 100}, {0, 150}` the element will render with a width of 100 pixels and height of 150 pixels.

If the GUI has a parent, its size of each axis is also influenced by the parent’s `GuiObject/SizeConstraint`.

/** GuiObject is an abstract class (much like `BasePart`) for a 2D user interface object. It defines all the properties relating to the display of a graphical user interface (GUI) object such as `GuiObject/Size` and `GuiObject/Position`. It also has some useful read-only properties like `GuiObject/AbsolutePosition`, `GuiObject/AbsoluteSize`, and `GuiObject/AbsoluteRotation`. It should be noted that `GuiObject` can have negative sizes and render normally, though `GuiObject/AnchorPoint` ought to be used to better control rendering.

To manipulate the layout of a GuiObject in special ways, you can use a `UIComponent` class such as `UIListLayout`, `UIPadding` or `UIScale`.

This class defines very simple animation methods: `GuiObject/TweenPosition`, `GuiObject/TweenSize` and `GuiObject/TweenSizeAndPosition` are good alternatives to `TweenService` for beginners.

GuiObject also defines events for user input like `GuiObject/MouseEnter`, `GuiObject/TouchTap`, `GuiObject/InputBegan`, `GuiObject/InputChanged` and `GuiObject/InputEnded`. The last three of these mimic the events of `UserinputService` of the same name. Although it is possible to detect mouse button events on any GuiObject using `GuiObject/InputBegan`, only `ImageButton` and `TextButton` have dedicated events for these (e.g. `TextButton/MouseButton1Down`). This event ought not be used for general button activation since not all platforms use a mouse; see `TextButton/Activated`. */

### Caveats

- Currently 3D objects can only be displayed on `ScreenGui|ScreenGuis` or `PluginGui|PluginGuis`
- Objects inside ViewportFrames are rendered using a fixed `Lighting|lighting` setting
- No shadow or post effects are available. Neon and Glass `Enum/Material|materials` will be rendered on lowest quality

### Using ViewportFrames

#### Through Studio UI

1. Add a ViewportFrame into a `LayerCollector|GuiLayerCollector`, such as a ScreenGui or `SurfaceGui`. This will cause a blank UI element to appear in the main window.

![ScreenGui->ViewportFrame in Explorer](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5c5e4fa022bf52f7439e2708/ViewportFrameThroughStudioUI1.png)

![Empty ViewportFrame in Workspace](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5c5e4fa800babade43223631/ViewportFrameThroughStudioUI2.png)

2. Add a model that you want to show in the ViewportFrame into `Workspace`. Target your camera towards the `Model|model`.

![Model being displayed by ViewportFrame](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5c5e4fb70ab91ed943f43e17/ViewportFrameThroughStudioUI3.png)

3. Set `ViewportFrame/CurrentCamera` to Workspace.Camera. Drag the model into the ViewportFrame. The model should show up there.

![ScreenGui->ViewportFrame->Model in Explorer](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5c5e4fd5ab181759419c65d6/ViewportFrameThroughStudioUI4.png)

![ViewportFrame Rendering Model](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5c5e5a5922bf52f7439e271e/ViewportFrameThroughStudioUI5.png)

4. You can change the size, position or other properties of ViewportFrame like other GUIs. Now the CurrentCamera is a reference to the main camera in Workspace, so if you move the camera in the main scene, it will also affect ViewportFrame. When you find a good position, duplicate the camera and make sure it is not the one Workspace is using. Then set it to ViewportFrame.CurrentCamera so the camera won’t be changed by Workspace operations.

![Gif of ViewportFrame Rendering Model](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5c5e4ff73f992ead41225138/ViewportFrameThroughStudioUI6.gif)

#### Through Scripts

You can also set up a ViewportFrame using scripts. Add the following `LocalScript` into a ScreenGui (or other proper Guis), run the game and you will get a `BasePart|Part` rendered inside a ViewportFrame.

```lua
local vf = Instance.new("ViewportFrame", script.Parent)
vf.Size = UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)
vf.Position = UDim2.new(0.25, 0, 0.25, 0)
vf.BackgroundColor3 = Color3.new(1, 1, 1)

local part = Instance.new("Part", vf)
part.Position = Vector3.new(0, 0, 0)

local camera = Instance.new("Camera", vf)
vf.CurrentCamera = camera

local cameraPosition = Vector3.new(3, 3, 3)
camera.CFrame = CFrame.new(cameraPosition, part.Position)
```

If you want to change the client’s Camera, you have to create a new Camera using a `LocalScript` at runtime.

By default, when the user clicks the ‘x’ button in the top right corner of the `PluginGui` the `LayerCollector/Enabled|Enabled` property is set to *false*, closing the window. When a custom function is bound using BindToClose this behavior is overwritten, allowing you to check if the user really wants to close the window or give them an opportunity to save their work.

As the default closing behavior is overwritten by this function, you’ll need to configure the `PluginGui` to close manually by setting `LayerCollector/Enabled|PluginGui.Enabled` to *false*. For example, in the below snippet users are required to click a confirm button to close the GUI:

```lua
local closing = false
pluginGui:BindToClose(function()
    -- make sure we haven't already made a button
    if closing then
        return
    end
    closing = true

    -- create confirm button
    local confirmButton = Instance.new("TextButton")
    confirmButton.AnchorPoint = Vector2.new(0.5, 0.5)
    confirmButton.Size = UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)
    confirmButton.Position = UDim2.new(0.5, 0, 0.5, 0)
    confirmButton.BackgroundColor3 = Color3.new(1, 0, 0)
    confirmButton.Text = "Close?"
    confirmButton.Parent = pluginGui

    -- listen for click
    confirmButton.Activated:Connect(function()
        -- close the gui
        pluginGui.Enabled = false

        -- remove confirm button
        confirmButton:Destroy()
    end)
end)
```

You can call BindToClose with no argument to ‘unbind’ and revert to the default behavior described above. For example:

```lua
pluginGui:BindToClose()
```

/** This service allows HTTP requests to be sent from game servers. This enables users to create integration with a wide range of third party services such as analytics and storage. One exciting prospect for this service is that if you run and manage your own website, and communicate with it from Roblox, it opens the possibility of remote server management and real time communication with the server, through your site.

If the limit of 500 http `HttpService/GetAsync|GET` / `HttpService/PostAsync|POST` requests per minute is exceeded, the Service will stall entirely for approximately 30 seconds.

### Enabling HTTP requests

HttpService starts off as disabled by default.

To `HttpService/HttpEnabled|enable` HTTP requests, the HttpService must be enabled through Studio’s Game Settings by opening the game’s settings via the **Game Settings** button on the *Home* tab of the game’s studio window (see image below):

![Navigate to the Game Settings button](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b7cc11cfcd8df450b22da14/HttpRequestsSetting.png)

Within the Game Settings window, navigate to the **Security** tab and select the *On* option under **Allow HTTP Requests** (see image below).

![Allow HTTP Requests](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b7cc0dfacedd45c0bf7b421/GameSettingsButton.png)

### Usage ideas

- Cross server marketplace
- Real time stock market
- Cross server leaderboard

### Restrictions

- Limit of 500 requests a minute (Per server)
- This service is not allowed to send requests to any of the Roblox websites such as [www.roblox.com]() or [api.roblox.com]()

Can be any string, including binary data. Must be excluded when using the GET or HEAD HTTP methods. It might be necessary to specify the Content-Type

 header when sending JSON or other formats. |

### HTTP Headers

In the request dictionary, you can specify custom HTTP headers to use in the request. However, some headers cannot be specified. For example, Content-Length

 is determined from the request body. User-Agent

 and Roblox-Id

 are locked by Roblox. Other headers like `Accept` or Cache-Control

 use default values but can be overridden. More commonly, some REST APIs may require API keys or other service authentication to be specified in request headers.

This method does not detect the format of body content. Many web servers require the Content-Type

 header be set appropriately when sending certain formats. Other methods of `HttpService` use the `Enum/HttpContentType|HttpContentType` enum; for this method set the Content-Type

 header appropriately: `text/plain`, `text/xml`, `application/xml`, `application/json` or application/x-www-form-urlencoded

 are replacement Content-Type

 header values for the respective enum values.

### Response Dictionary Fields

The function returns a dictionary containing the following fields:

### Error Cases

This method raises an error if the response times out or if the target server rejects the request. If a web service goes down for some reason, it can cause scripts that use this method to stop functioning altogether. It is often a good idea to wrap calls to this method in `pcall` and gracefully handle failure cases if the required information isn’t available.

### Limitations

The current limitation for sending and receiving HTTP requests is 500 requests per minute. Requests over this threshold will fail. Additionally, Roblox domains are blacklisted. This means that HTTP requests cannot be sent to any Roblox owned site, such as [www.roblox.com](). */

/** The Humanoid is a special object that gives models the functionality of a character. It grants the model with the ability to physically walk around and interact with various components of a Roblox level.

Humanoids are always parented inside of a `Model`, and the model is expected to be an assembly of `BasePart` and `Motor6D`; the root part of the assembly is expected to be named *HumanoidRootPart*. It also expects a part named *Head* to be connected to the character’s torso part, either directly or indirectly.

By default, there are two official types of character rigs supplied by Roblox, each with their own set of rules:

### R6

 A basic character rig that uses 6 parts for limbs.

 The Head part must be attached to a part named Torso, or the Humanoid will die immediately.

 BodyPart appearances are applied using CharacterMesh objects.

 Certain properties, such as Humanoid/LeftLeg and Humanoid/RightLeg, only work with R6.

### R15

 More complex than R6, but also far more flexible and robust.

 Uses 15 parts for limbs.

 The Head part must be attached to a part named UpperTorso or the Humanoid will die immediately.

 BodyPart appearances have to be assembled directly.

 Can be dynamically rescaled by using special NumberValue objects parented inside of the Humanoid.  The Humanoid will automatically create Vector3Value objects named OriginalSize inside of each limb. If a NumberValue is parented inside of the Humanoid and is named one of the following, it will be used to control the scaling functionality:  BodyDepthScale BodyHeightScale BodyWidthScale HeadScale */

Currently, this property only works when the following conditions are true:

- The Humanoid’s character model is the `Player/Character` of a `Player`.
- The Player in question is using touch controls.

When a player’s character spawns, the property’s value matches the player’s `Player/AutoJumpEnabled` property - which in turn matches the `StarterPlayer/AutoJumpEnabled` property. */
	AutoJumpEnabled: boolean;
	/** The AutoRotate property is a boolean that describes whether or not the Humanoid will automatically rotate to face in the direction they are moving. When set to true, the character model will gradually turn to face their movement direction as the Humanoid walks around. When set to false, the character model will remain fixated in its current rotation, unless a rotating force is applied to the *HumanoidRootPart*.

If the character model happens to be the character of a player, then the behavior of the Humanoid’s rotation is influenced by the UserGameSetting’s RotateType property.

When the AutoRotate property is set to true, the RotateType property has the following effects on the Humanoid’s rotation:

	/** The DisplayDistanceType property controls how the humanoid display’s visibility behaves, based on the distance between the `Humanoid` and the player’s view.

When a Humanoid’s parent `BaseModel` has a part named *Head*, a visual display of the `Player`'s name and health is drawn 1.5 studs above the character’s head. This visual display is known as the **Humanoid Display**.

This property is set using the `Enum/HumanoidDisplayDistanceType` enum. There are three available values for this property, each with their own set of rules:

### None

When the DisplayDistanceType is set to **None**, the humanoid display will not be shown under any circumstances.

### Viewer

When the DisplayDistanceType is set to **Viewer**, the humanoid display’s visibility is locally controlled by the NameDisplayDistance and HealthDisplayDistance of each Player in the game. For instance, if a player has their display distance properties set to 50, and everyone else has their display distance properties set to 100, then that player will not be able to see the name and health of the humanoid at a distance greater than 50 studs, while everyone else can still see the name and health of the humanoid up to a distance of 100 studs.

![Viewer example](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blta3653f27a817f4f1/HumanoidViewerDistance.png)

In this example all of the NPC characters have their DisplayDistanceType set to Viewer. This means the distance the information will be displayed will be taken from the humanoid that is viewing them. In this case, the player character (who is in the foreground) has its HealthDisplayDistance set to 10 and NameDisplayDistance set to 20. The health bar is only visible on the closest NPC because it is within 10 studs, and the names of only the two closer NPCs are visible because they are within 20 studs.

---

### Subject

When the DisplayDistanceType is set to **Subject** the Humanoid’s name and healthbar will be displayed based on the viewed humanoid’s settings. This is useful when there are specific characters who you want to behave differently from other ones.

![Subject example](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt0484c3c0f5a98d64/HumanoidSubjectDistance.png)

In this example all of the NPC characters have their DisplayDistanceType set to Subject. This means the view distance of their information will depend on their individual HealthDisplayDistance and NameDisplayDistance properties.

- The NPC on the left has its HealthDisplayDistance and NameDisplayDistance set to 10. Since the NPC is 15 studs away, neither of the displays are visible.

- The NPC in the middle has its HealthDisplayDistance set to 10 and NameDisplayDistance set to 20. Since the NPC is 15 studs away, only the name is visible.

- The NPC on the right has its HealthDisplayDistance and NameDisplayDistance set to 20. Both name and health are visible, as the NPC is only 15 studs away. */

**FloorMaterial** is a read-only property that describes what type of Material the Humanoid is currently standing on.

 It works with both regular parts and terrain voxels.

### Caveats

- When the Humanoid is not standing on a floor, the value of this property will be set to *Air*. - This occurs because Enum properties cannot have an empty value.
    - This can cause some confusion if a part has its material is set to Air, though in practice, parts are not supposed to use that material in the first place.

- The Humanoid’s character model must be able to collide with the floor, or else it will not be detected. - You cannot test if the Humanoid is swimming with this property. You should instead use the Humanoid’s GetState function. */

	/** ![A Humanoid with half of its health left.](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt1c35a737d3dcdb25/Half-Health.png)

**Health** is a property that represents the current health of the Humanoid.

 Its value is constrained between 0, and the value of the Humanoid’s MaxHealth.

---

### Display Behavior

![The behavior of the HealthDIsplayType property](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt25d44cecfd3e9e09/HealthDisplayType.gif)

By default, the Humanoid displays a health bar under its name label when the Humanoid has taken damage. The display behavior of the health bar is dependent on the Humanoid’s HealthDisplayDistance and HealthDisplayType properties.

![The default health bar displayed in Roblox's top bar](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt081a90d0f606c745/CoreGuiHealth.png)

From the perspective of a Player, their character will never display the standard humanoid name & health label. Instead, it is displayed in the top right corner of the screen. The health bar will only be shown when the character’s health isn’t full.

The player’s character also has a default script inserted into it called **Health**, that regenerates their health by 1% continuously every second, until it is restored to full health.

---

### Damaging Humanoids

![ForceFields make you immune to explosions!](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltfa7dc6cd34b05fae/ExplosionImmunity.png)

When making Humanoids take damage, you are advised to utilize the Humanoid’s TakeDamage function. The TakeDamage function properly ignores damage when the Humanoid’s character model has a ForceField parented inside of it.

The ForceField object makes the character immune to explosions and is expected to make them immune to damage as well. You are allowed to just subtract from the Humanoid’s health, but it ultimately depends on whether or not you incorporate ForceFields into your game.

---

### Out of Health!

![The same Humanoid from the beginning, after being bloxxed by an explosion.](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt9978f529dfcc80e6/Ooof.png)

When the value of the character’s health reaches 0, the Humanoid will automatically change into its *Dead* state, which makes the character break its joints and fall into pieces.

If there is a joint connecting the Head part to the character, the Head **must** remain connected to the character, such that `Head:GetRootPart() == Humanoid.RootPart`. You can think of the joint connection as the character’s neck. If you don’t have a neck between your head and torso, you are very dead. */

The DisplayDistanceType property is to one of three values using the `Enum/HumanoidDisplayDistanceType` enum.

---

### DisplayDistanceType set to “None”###

When a humanoid’s DisplayDistanceType is set to **None**, its health bar will never be visible to anyone under any circumstances.

---

### DisplayDistanceType set to “Viewer”###

When a humanoid’s DisplayDistanceType is set to **Viewer**, the visibility of its health bar is dependent upon the HealthDisplayDistance of the player viewing it.

If the distance between the character models of the viewer and the humanoid is outside the range of the viewer’s HealthDisplayDistance, then the health bar will not be shown to the viewer.

---

### DisplayDistanceType set to “Subject”###

When a humanoid’s DisplayDistanceType is set to **Subject**, the visibility of its health bar is dependent upon the value of the humanoid’s own HealthDisplayDistance.

If the distance between the character models of the viewing player and the humanoid is outside the range of the humanoid’s HealthDisplayDistance, then the health bar will not be shown to the viewing player.

	/** ![A side by side visualization of how HealthDisplayType impacts the behavior of the health bar's display](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt25d44cecfd3e9e09/HealthDisplayType.gif)

 HealthDisplayType controls when a humanoid’s health bar is allowed to be displayed.

By default, this property is set to **DisplayWhenDamaged**, which makes the health bar only display when a humanoid’s Health is less than its MaxHealth. It can also be set to **AlwaysOn**, which makes the health bar always display, or **AlwaysOff**, which prevents it from ever displaying.

This can be described in Lua as:

`goal = humanoid.WalkToPart.CFrame:pointToObjectSpace(humanoid.WalkToPoint)`

### Caveats

- Setting the value of WalkToPart isn’t sufficient enough to make a humanoid start following a part.
- The Humanoid is prompted to start attempting to reach a goal when the value of WalkToPoint is changed.
- This may be changed in the future.
- The *reach goal* state of a humanoid will timeout after 8 seconds if it doesn’t reach its goal.

If a humanoid’s `Humanoid/WalkToPart` is set, the goal is set by transforming WalkToPoint relative to the parts position and rotation. If WalkToPart is not set, then the humanoid will try to reach the 3D position specified by WalkToPoint directly.

### Caveats

- The value of WalkToPoint must be changed to a different value in order for the humanoid to start walking towards it.
- If you want to make a humanoid walk to `0,0,0`, you should use the Humanoid’s MoveTo function.

For `Player` `Player/Character|Characters` however this function needs calling every frame as the default control scripts overwrite it. This should be run from a `LocalScript` on the client. See below for an example:

```lua
RunService:BindToRenderStep("move",
    -- run after the character
    Enum.RenderPriority.Character.Value + 1,
    function()
        if localPlayer.Character then
            -- can save the below by using localPlayer:Move() instead
            local humanoid = localPlayer.Character:FindFirstChild("Humanoid")
            if humanoid then
                humanoid:Move(Vector3.new(0, 0, -1), true)
            end
        end
    end
)
```

	Move(moveDirection: Vector3, relativeToCamera?: boolean): void;
	/** This function causes the `Humanoid` to attempt to walk to the given location by setting the `Humanoid/WalkToPoint` and `Humanoid/WalkToPart` properties.

The *location* and *part* parameters correspond with what `Humanoid/WalkToPoint` and `Humanoid/WalkToPart` will be set to.

If the *part* parameter is specified, the `Humanoid` will still attempt to walk to the point. However, if the part moves then the point the `Humanoid` is walking to will move to be at the same position relative to the part. For a visual demonstration of this, see below.

![A visualization of how WalkToPart changes the behavior of WalkToPoint](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltc76671f1665d7da0/WalkToPart.gif)

The *reach goal* state of a humanoid will timeout after 8 seconds if it doesn’t reach its goal. This is done so that NPCs won’t get stuck waiting for `Humanoid/MoveToFinished` to fire. If you don’t want this to happen, you should repeatedly call MoveTo so that the timeout will keep resetting. */
	MoveTo(location: Vector3, part?: BasePart): void;
	/** This function removes all `Accessory|Accessories` worn by the `Humanoid`.

### How does RemoveAccessories work?

When this function is called, all `Accessory|Accessories` sharing an `Instance/Parent` with the `Humanoid` will be removed. For `Player`, `Player/Character|Characters` this will remove all hats being worn as hats take the form of `Accessory|Accessories` in the data model.

`Instance/Destroy` is called on the removed `Accessory|Accessories`, meaning their `Instance/Parent|Parents` are set to nil and locked.

The `Humanoid` does not need to belong to a `Player` `Player/Character` for this to work. This function will remove `Accessory|Accessories` parented to the `Humanoid|Humanoid's``Instance/Parent` regardless of where the `Humanoid` is.

If no `Tool` is equipped, this function will do nothing.

Although `Tool|Tools` can be equipped by NPCs (Non Player Characters), this function only works on `Humanoid|Humanoids` with a corresponding `Player`. This is because a `Backpack` object is required to parent the unequipped `Tool` to.

/** An object created when an input begins that describes a particular user input, such as mouse movement, touches, keyboard, and more.

The object’s properties vary according the the type of input. Properties can be used to determine input `Enum/UserInputState|state`, `Enum/UserInputType|type`, `DataType/Vector3|position`, `DataType/Vector3|delta`, and the `Enum/KeyCode` that triggered the input (if applicable).

Once created at the beginning of an input, the same object persists and is updated until the input ends. As a result, you can track the object’s changes using the `Instance/Changed|Changed` event as the user changes the input in question. You can also place these objects into a list of active inputs track and interact with the object after it’s creation by an event such as `UserInputService/InputBegan`.

Yikes! That quite confusing. Unfortunately this method was added in the earlier days of Roblox, where easy to understand return-types weren’t a priority.

Thankfully, an example for iterating over this list has been provided at the bottom of this page.

This line would return an `Instance` of the Doge model within your game. Changing the asset Id passed as an argument changes the asset that is loaded into your game.

Note, in most cases developers do not need to manipulate `KeyframeSequence`s as the animation editor covers most animation functionality. However, in some cases a developer may wish to generate an animation from a `Script` or build their own plugin.

**Structure**

Keyframes are held within a `KeyframeSequence` and contain `Pose` objects. The poses are named in accordance with the `BasePart`s they correspond to and are structured in terms of joint hierarchy. This means each `Pose` is parented to the `Pose` corresponding to the part it is attached to. See below for a visual example.

![](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt2e767397c28fecda/KeyframeSequence_-_Copy.png)

Note, as `Pose`s are named in accordance with the `BasePart`s they correspond to, animations require distinct part names to play correctly.

**Interpolation**

During animation playback the poses in different keyframes are interpolated between. This allows a smooth animation to be created without needing to define every frame. Note, the style of interpolation is determined in the `Pose` object. The Keyframe object merely holds the `Pose`s at a defined point of time in the animation (`Keyframe/Time`). */

/** A KeyframeMarker is an instance meant to represent an event that will eventually be fired when a `Keyframe` is hit.

### Using a KeyframeMarker

KeyframeMarkers should always be parented to a Keyframe via setting the parent directly or using the `Keyframe/AddMarker` function of Keyframe. KeyframeMarkers can also be removed directly or using the `Keyframe/RemoveMarker` function, and polled to check which markers are attached to a specific Keyframe using `Keyframe/GetMarkers`.

Whenever a Keyframe is detected as an animation is running, there will be an event fired for each KeyframeMarker that is parented to the Keyframe. These events are identifiable by the name of the KeyframeMarker. You can retrieve and listen to these events using the `AnimationTrack/GetKeyframeMarkerReached` function. Optionally, you may set the `KeyframeMarker/Value` property of the KeyframeMarker in order to pass along a value with the event being fired.

It inherits the `Instance/Name|Keyframe.Name` property from `Instance` and behaves identically. Names are used for identification and no not need to be unique.

/** This object stores all the `Keyframe`s for an animation, determines if the animation is looped, and determines its priority against other animations.

### What is a Keyframe Sequence?

The animation data Roblox uses in the playback of an animation, referenced by the `Animation/AnimationId` property, is constructed from a KeyframeSequence. Every animation has a KeyframeSequence associated with it. KeyframeSequences are usually created by the Roblox Animation Editor but can be created through other plugins or even manually. Once uploaded to Roblox, their Content ID is used for the `Animation/AnimationId` property.

Note, in most cases developers do not need to manipulate KeyframeSequences as the animation editor covers most animation functionality. However, in some cases a developer may wish to generate an animation from a `Script` or build their own plugin.

### KeyframeSequence Properties

The priority and looped animation settings are set by `KeyframeSequence/Priority` and `KeyframeSequence/Loop`. Note these can be eventually overwritten by the `AnimationTrack` properties.

The length of an animation is determined by the last `Keyframe` in the sequence, meaning the `Keyframe` with the highest `Keyframe/Time` property.

### KeyframeSequence Structure

KeyframeSequences are a container that hold `Keyframe`s. Keyframes represent a ‘key’ frame in the animation, that are interpolated between during playback.

Keyframes contain `Pose`s. `Pose`s are specific to each `BasePart` being animated and contain the `CFrame` applied to the `Motor6D` connecting to the part. Poses are named according to the `BasePart` they correspond with. For this reason, animations require distinct part names to play correctly.

Poses are structured based on joint hierarchy. Each `Pose` is parented to the `Pose` corresponding to the part it is attached to. In practice, this means the poses branch out from the root part. See below for a visual example.

![](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt2e767397c28fecda/KeyframeSequence_-_Copy.png)

### Using KeyframeSequences when making animations

KeyframeSequences must be first uploaded to Roblox before they can be played. This can be done by right clicking on the KeyframeSequence and clicking ‘Save to Roblox’. Alternatively, `Plugin/SaveSelectedToRoblox` can be used. This will bring up the animation upload window.

In some cases, a developer may want to preview an Animation before uploading it to the Roblox site. This can be achieved by generating a temporary id using `KeyframeSequenceProvider/RegisterKeyframeSequence`. This will generate a hash id that can be used for localized animation testing.

### Obtaining KeyframeSequences

In some cases the developer may wish to download the KeyframeSequence corresponding to an existing uploaded Animation. This can be done so using `KeyframeSequenceProvider/GetKeyframeSequenceAsync`. */

### How does fog work?

Fog in Roblox is displayed in a plane perpendicular to the `Workspace/CurrentCamera`s direction. It fades between the `Lighting/FogStart` property where it is not visible, to the `Lighting/FogEnd` property where it is fully opaque. The effect of fog is it blends color with the FogColor.

At distances greater than `Lighting/FogEnd`, color will be determined entirely by the FogColor. However at distances between `Lighting/FogStart` and `Lighting/FogEnd` the degree to which the color is blended depends on the position.

Roblox’s fog uses linear interpolation between `Lighting/FogStart` and `Lighting/FogEnd`. This means if `Lighting/FogStart` is 10 and `Lighting/FogEnd` is 20, at a distance of 15 studs the fog will be at 50%. That means the color of a pixel at 15 studs will be 50% its normal color blended with 50% of the fog color.

```lua
local Lighting = game:GetService("Lighting")
-- fog will fade between 25 and 200 studs
Lighting.FogStart = 25
Lighting.FogEnd = 200

### What does GlobalShadows do?

When set to true, shadows are rendered in sheltered areas depending on the position of the sun and moon. The lighting hue applied to these areas is determined by the `Lighting/Ambient` property. The lighting hue in all other areas is determined by the `Lighting/OutdoorAmbient` property.

When disabled, shadows are not drawn and no distinction is made between indoor and outdoor areas. As a result, the `Lighting/Ambient` property determines the lighting hue and `Lighting/OutdoorAmbient` will do nothing.

Shadows are calculated using a voxel system, and each lighting voxel is 4x4x4 studs. This means objects need to be larger than 4x4x4 studs to display a realistic shadow. Shadows are also recalculated when `BasePart`s are moving.

Note, this property is unrelated to shadows from characters which are displayed regardless of what GlobalShadows is set to.

For more information about Roblox’s dynamic lighting, please see this [blog post]().

### Toggling GlobalShadows

Developers toggling the GlobalShadows setting will notice that disabling it makes the place considerably darker. This is because when GlobalShadows is disabled `Lighting/Ambient` is used to calculate the lighting hue in both indoor and ourdoor spaces. This darkness can be resolved by setting `Lighting/Ambient` to a higher value such as `Lighting/OutdoorAmbient`'s default value of 127, 127, 127.

In most cases developers are recommended to leave GlobalShadows enabled due to the superior visual appearance. See the image below for a comparison.

LocalizationTables are designed to be treated as resources, like a texture or a script. They are not optimized to be modified at runtime. Changing a the contents of a table will cause the entire contents of the table to be replicated to all players.

### LocalizationTable Entries

Each LocalizationTable contains a set of entries. Each entry contains the translations of the text, along with some special fields:

¨NBSP;Key is an optional unique key for fast hash lookups in code. If it is non-empty it must be unique in the table.

Source is the orignal text in the source language that will be used by the LocalizationService automatic text replacement system to match GUI text and render a translation instead. The Source field can be filled by the text capture tools, or can be set manually. For key-based lookups the Source value can be used as a translation for LocalizationTable/SourceLocaleId if the entry doesn’t have a translation for that locale. If Source is empty then the entry will not be used by the automatic replacement system.

Context is the full Instance name for the object that the text appeared on. Context is used for disambiguation by the automatic text replacement system. When multiple matches for the Source are found, the system will pick the best match by matching backwards from the end of the Context string. There are other more robust ways to handle disambiguation available as well, like using multiple tables with GuiBase2d/RootLocalizationTable.

Example is whatever you want it to be. If the text capture tool guessed some parameters for a string the Example field will contain an example of them used in context.

 All of these fields are optional, but at least either Key or Source must be non-empty. No two entries can have the same Key, Source, and Context.

The **Source** field and all translation strings must be valid [LocalizationService format strings](https://developer.roblox.com/articles/Format-Strings). */

/** A ModuleScript is a type of Lua source container that runs once and must return exactly one value. This value is then returned by a call to `require` given the ModuleScript as the only argument. ModuleScripts run once and only once per Lua environment and return the exact same value for subsequent calls to `require`.

ModuleScripts are essential objects for adhering to the don’t-repeat-yourself (DRY) principle. When you write a function, write it only once and use it everywhere. Having multiple copies of a function is disastrous when you need to change that behavior. So, you should define functions or groups of functions in ModuleScripts and have your Scripts and LocalScripts call `require` on your ModuleScripts. Keep your code organized!

It’s important to know that return values from ModuleScripts are independent with regards to LocalScripts and Scripts, and other environments like the Command Bar. Using `require` on a ModuleScript in a LocalScript will run the code on the client, even if a Script did so already on the server. Similarly, in Roblox Studio, using `require` on a ModuleScript in the hierarchy with the Command Bar will give a similar behavior. So, be careful if you are using a ModuleScript on the client and server at the same time, or debugging it within Studio.

Note that the first call to `require` on a ModuleScript will not yield (halt) unless the ModuleScript yields (e.g. calls `wait`). The current thread that called `require` will yield until a ModuleScript returns a value. A run time error is generated if this doesn’t happen. If a ModuleScript is attempting to `require` another ModuleScript that in turn tries to `require`s it, the **thread will hang and never halt (cyclic `require` calls do not generate errors).** Be mindful of your module dependencies in large projects!

If a ModuleScript object is has its Name property set to ‘MainModule’ and is uploaded to Roblox as a model to your account, Scripts can use `require` with the uploaded model’s AssetId instead. This allows you to create private modules on your Roblox account! */

/** MarketplaceService is the game service that is responsible for in-game transactions.

The most notable functions are `MarketplaceService/PromptProductPurchase|PromptProductPurchase` and `MarketplaceService/PromptPurchase|PromptPurchase`, as well as the callback `MarketplaceService/ProcessReceipt|ProcessReceipt` which must be well defined so that transactions do not fail.

MarketplaceService also has functions that fetch information about developer products (`MarketplaceService/GetProductInfo|GetProductInfo` and `MarketplaceService/GetDeveloperProductsAsync|GetDeveloperProductsAsync`), game passes (`MarketplaceService/UserOwnsGamePassAsync|UserOwnsGamePassAsync`), and other assets (`MarketplaceService/PlayerOwnsAsset|PlayerOwnsAsset`).

### Monetization

Learning to use MarketplaceService is the first step towards learning to monetize a game on Roblox. Be extra mindful when using these features, as failed sales and sale-related bugs can be incredibly frustrating to deal with. Another important game service regarding monetization is `DataStoreService` which is responsible for saving and loading data like that of purchases. When processing purchases, it is often a good idea to check using data stores that a player hasn’t already been granted a product. Remember: all of the current financial rules of Roblox apply to in-game sales. At the moment, members of Builders Club will earn 70% of the total cost of the transaction and 10% for affiliate gear sales. If you are not a Builders Club member, you instead earn 10% of the total cost of the transaction.

### Purchase Prompt

Below is an example of an in-game developer product purchase prompt for a product called “XP Boost”, with a price of R$ 25. The player is presented with the choice “Buy Now” or “Cancel”. Upon confirming the purchase, the `MarketplaceService/ProcessReceipt|ProcessReceipt` callback will be invoked with information about the purchase so the game may grant the product (in this case, the XP Boost). In studio, purchases will not charge the developer account and will be marked as such in the prompt.

![A screenshot of the in-game purchase prompt asking "Want to buy the product XP Boost for R$ 25? This is a test purchase. Your account will not be charged "](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b61f4394bf5bf624023e72b/PromptProductPurchase.png)

### Sale Processing

interface MarketplaceService extends RbxInternalInstance {
	/** The string name of this Instance's most derived class. */

     process such purchases you need to set the

    `MarketplaceService/ProcessReceipt|ProcessReceipt` callback in a

     single script.

- For **affiliate gear sales** or other assets, use

    `MarketplaceService/PromptPurchaseFinished`. */
	readonly PromptGamePassPurchaseFinished: RBXScriptSignal<
		(player: Player, gamePassId: number, wasPurchased: boolean) => void
	>;
	/** PromptPurchaseFinished fires when a purchase dialogue of an affiliate gear sale or other asset is closed. This fires right as the dialogue closes when the player presses “Cancel” at the prompt, or “OK” at the success/error message.

- For **game passes**, use `MarketplaceService/PromptGamePassPurchaseFinished`.
- For **developer product** purchase prompts, connect to `MarketplaceService/PromptProductPurchaseFinished`. In order to process such purchases you need to set the `MarketplaceService/ProcessReceipt|ProcessReceipt` callback in a single script.

### Example

Below is a screenshot of an affiliate gear sale prompt. The function in the code sample runs immediately after the player presses “Cancel” or after the user buys the item then presses “OK”. Should there be an issue with the purchase, the event also fires.

![A product purchase prompt for an affiliate gear sale](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5c3f7bb9aae307c07f2f485f/PromptProductPurchase-confirm.png)

```lua
local MarketplaceService = game:GetService("MarketplaceService")

MarketplaceService.PromptPurchaseFinished:connect(function (...)
	-- Print all the details of the prompt, for example:
	-- PromptPurchaseFinished PlayerName 11377306 true
	print("PromptPurchaseFinished", ...)
end)
``` */
	readonly PromptPurchaseFinished: RBXScriptSignal<(player: Player, assetId: number, isPurchased: boolean) => void>;
	/** After a player makes a purchase through a `MarketplaceService/PromptProductPurchase|PromptProductPurchase()` dialog, this callback is called multiple times until it returns `Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.PurchaseGranted`. For example, the function is called again for a product when the player joins the game — or even after they have bought something else — **unless** you return `Enum.ProductPurchaseDecision.PurchaseGranted`.

It’s important to carefully examine the information passed to the callback via the **receipt info table** and properly process the receipt. See the code sample below for a model of how to create a receipt handling callback.

 Care and caution are highly recommended in implementing this callback as small mistakes run the risk of failed sales.

 As with all callbacks, this function should be set once and only once by a single Script. If you're selling multiple products in your game, this callback must handle receipts for all of them.

### Developer Product Example

The following example loads information about a developer product.

```lua
local PRODUCT_ID = 336755544

local MarketplaceService = game:GetService("MarketplaceService")

local productInfo = MarketplaceService:GetProductInfo(PRODUCT_ID, Enum.InfoType.Product)

print("Product ID " .. PRODUCT_ID .. " name: " .. productInfo.Name)

if productInfo.Description then
	print("Description: " .. productInfo.Description)
else
	print("No description!")
end

if productInfo.IsForSale then
	print("It is on sale for " .. productInfo.PriceInRobux .. " Robux.")
end

print("The image icon is: rbxassetid://" .. productInfo.IconImageAssetId)
```

### Use in Studio Plugins

This method is often used by plugins to detect old versions and notify the user to manually update a plugin. The plugin author uploads a dummy asset, such as a decal or model, then puts the present version of the plugin in that asset’s description. The plugin then calls this method and checks an internal version number for a newer version.

### Possible Errors

If no such item exists with the given ID, this function will throw an error:

- For developer products, the error is:

> *MarketplaceService:getProductInfo() failed because rawProductInfo was empty*

- For game passes and assets, the error is:

> *MarketplaceService:getProductInfo() failed because HTTP 0 (HTTP 400 (HTTP/1.1 400 BadRequest))* */
	GetProductInfo(assetId: number, infoType: CastsToEnum<Enum.InfoType.Asset>): AssetProductInfo;

In the case that a query fails, this function will throw an error. Therefore, it is recommended to wrap calls to this function in `pcall`.

- This method should not be used for **game passes**, since they use a separate ID system. Legacy game passes that still depend on an asset ID should use `GamePassService/PlayerHasPass` instead of this method.
- This method cannot be used to check for **developer products** since they can be purchased multiple times but not owned themselves. Use a `GlobalDataStore` to save when a developer has bought a developer product instead. */

	/** UserOwnsGamePassAsync returns true if the `Player` with the given `Player/UserId|UserId` owns the game pass with the given **game pass ID** (not to be confused with asset ID).

### Caching Behavior

Results of this function are remembered so that repeated calls will return quicker. This function will always return true if the player owns the game pass upon first entering a server after having purchased the game pass. If the game pass is purchased in-game (through `MarketplaceService/PromptGamePassPurchase|PromptGamePassPurchase`), this function may return false due to the caching behavior. Conversely, should the player delete the game pass from their inventory, this function may return true despite the player not owning the game pass.

### History

Previously, querying player ownership of game passes required the use of the now-deprecated `GamePassService/PlayerHasPass` function. This was changed in April 2018 when [game passes received their own ID system]().

On [Release 350](https://developer.roblox.com/resources/release-note/Release-Note-for-350) (August 2018), this function was changed so that the result is cached. Previously, it made a request every time it was called. */

The MessagingService allows game servers in the same game to communicate with each other in real time (< 1 second) using topics. Topics are developer defined strings (1-80 characters) that game servers can send and receive messages.

Delivery is best effort and not guaranteed. Make sure to architect your game so delivery failures are not critical.

### Limitations

Note: these limits are subject to change at any time.

| Limit                         | Maximum                       |

### Callback

The callback is invoked with two arguments:

| Field                                              | Summary                                            |

It yields until the subscription is properly registered and returns a connection object.

To unsubscribe, call `Datatype/RBXScriptConnection|:Disconnect()` on the returned object. Once Disconnect() is called, the callback should never be invoked. Killing the script containing the connections also causes the underlying connect to be unsubscribed.

Developers can get obtain the position of Hit like so:

```lua
local position = mouse.Hit.p
```

Hit is often used by `Tool`s to fire a weapon towards the mouse in third person.

Developers looking for the `BasePart` the mouse is pointing at should use `Mouse/Target`.

### How is Mouse.Hit calculated?

The position of the Hit CFrame is calculated as the point of intersection between the mouse’s internal `DataType/Ray` (an extended version of `Mouse/UnitRay`) and an object in 3D space (such as a part).

The orientation of the Hit CFrame corresponds with the direction of the `Mouse/UnitRay`.

```lua
local unitRayDirection = mouse.UnitRay.Direction
local mouseHitDirection = mouse.Hit.lookVector
-- unitRayDirection ≈ mouseHitDirection
-- the vectors are approximately equal
```

Note, the roll of the `Workspace/CurrentCamera` is not used when calculating the orientation of the Hit `DataType/CFrame`.

The mouse’s internal ray extends for 1000 studs. If the mouse is not pointing at an object in 3D space (for example when pointing at the sky), this property will be 1000 studs away from the `Workspace/CurrentCamera`.This property indicates `DataType/CFrame` of the mouse’s position in 3D space.

### How to get the Mouse?

A Mouse object is not createable, but can be obtained using the `Player/GetMouse`, `Tool/Equipped`. The `PluginMouse` object, which inherits from Mouse can be created using the `Plugin` `Plugin/GetMouse` function.

```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local localPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer -- from a LocalScript
local mouse = Player:GetMouse()
```

```lua
Tool.Equipped:Connect(function(mouse)
	-- got mouse
end)
```

### Mouse alternatives

There is a degree of overlap between the functionality offered by `ContextActionService`, `UserInputService` and the Mouse object.

Mouse, by and large, has been superseded by `UserInputService` which offers wider additional functionality for interacting with the mouse as well as other input types. For example:

- `UserInputService` supports other inputs such as key presses and mobile inputs whereas `Mouse` does not
- `UserInputService` includes additional mouse features such as `UserInputService/MouseBehavior` and `UserInputService/MouseDeltaSensitivity`

In most cases developers are advised to use the new `UserInputService`. However the Mouse object remains supported for a number of reasons.

- Mouse existed long before `UserInputService` and a large number of places and gear items are dependent on it
- The `PluginMouse` object is still used by plugins accessing the mouse
- The mouse object is embedded into `Tool`s and is easier to pick up for new developers */

### Outdated Physics Packet

This following debug message is printed if the PhysicsReceiver receives a mechanism update packet for a part that has been updated ahead of the packet’s submission time:

`Physics-in old packet`

This happens if the packet is received late, and a newer packet has already been processed.

---

`Physics-in of unidentified {GUID}`

 (Where `{GUID}` is the unknown `Instance/GetDebugId` identifier that is supposed to be targeting the part)

This typically happens if a part is removed before the physics update packet is received.

---

### Invalid Part

This following debug message is printed if the PhysicsReceiver receives a request to update the physics of a part that is not a descendant of the Workspace:

`Physics-in of part not in workspace {GUID}`

 (Where `{GUID}` is the `Instance/GetDebugId` identifier of the target part)

/** BasePart is an abstract base class for in-world objects that render and are physically simulated while in the `Workspace`. There are several implementations of BasePart, the most common is `Part`, a simple 6-face rectangular prism. Others include `SpawnLocation`, `WedgePart` and the singleton `Terrain` object within the `Workspace`. Most of the time, when documentation refers to a part, most BasePart implementations will work and not just `Part`.

There are **many** different objects that interact with BasePart:

- They may be grouped within a `Model`, which allows several BasePart to be moved at the same time using `Model/SetPrimaryPartCFrame|SetPrimaryPartCFrame`.
- A `Decal` applies a stretched image texture to the faces of a part, though the exact mapping depends on the type of part.
- A `Texture` applies a tiled image texture to the faces of a part much like a `Decal`.
- A `SurfaceGui` renders `GuiObject|GuiObjects` on the face of a part.
- An `Attachment` can be added to specify a CFrames relative to a parent BasePart. These are often used by physics `Constraint` objects, such as `RopeConstraint` and `HingeConstraint`.
- `ParticleEmitter` emit particles uniformly in the volume of the BasePart to which they are parented.
- Light objects like `PointLight` emit light from the center of a BasePart.
- When `Sound/Play|played`, a `Sound` parented to a BasePart will be physically located at the part’s position.
- `BodyMover` objects like `BodyVelocity` exert forces on the BasePart to which they are parented.
- As a sibling of a `Humanoid`, they can be used as limbs of a character and also animated when joined using `Motor6D`. If not a sibling of a `Humanoid`, BasePart can still be animated using an `AnimationController`.
- In Studio, you can use most implementations of BaseParts with solid modelling.
- If parented to a `Tool` and given the name “Handle”, a BasePart can be held by characters.
- You can make BasePart interactive by adding a `ClickDetector`
- You can a mesh like a `BlockMesh` or `SpecialMesh` to change how a BasePart looks without change how it physically behaves. */

/** ### What is a Part

The Part object is a physical object. When it is in the `Workspace`, it will move and interact with other Parts. It can have bonds formed with other Parts, so that the two Parts stay in the same relative position.

Parts are the basic building blocks of any Roblox place. Commonly known as **bricks**, you’ll see these the most often of any other objects as almost every place is built out of these. It is possible to stretch a Part to very large sizes and use them for baseplates, or make them very small and use them to create cool looking `Tool`.

### How can I edit a Part

The Part object can be edited using the various studio tools. It is available via either the insert menu, or the *Object Insert menu*. It can also be created using the function:

```lua
Instance.new("Part")
```

### How do I create different shaped Parts

Using the Mesh objects, such as `SpecialMesh`, `BlockMesh`, or `CylinderMesh` objects you can change the shape of them. Using the `Decal` or `Texture` objects, you can place pictures on top of the bricks.

### Changing Parts using scripts

There are many scripting opportunities using the Part object. Many of the other scripting objects, such as `BodyForce` objects operate inside of a Part or other physics based objects. Editing the Part’s properties through a script can result in a lot of fun opportunities. */

/** A type of `BasePart` that a player character can ‘sit’ in. When a character touches an enabled Seat object, it will be attached to the part by a `Weld` and the default character scripts will play a sitting animation.

### How do Seats work?

When a model containing a `Humanoid` and a `BasePart` called ‘HumanoidRootPart’ (generally a player character) touches a seat, a `Weld` is created between the seat and the part. The `JointInstance/C0|C0` and `JointInstance/C1|C1` properties are configured so that the character is welded 2 studs above the seat. This weld is named ‘SeatWeld’ and parented to the seat.

When sitting the `Seat/Occupant` property is set to the `Humanoid` that is ‘sitting’ in the seat. Furthermore the `Humanoid/SeatPart` property of the humanoid is set to the seat.

A character can also be forced to sit in a seat using the `Seat/Sit` function.

There are two ways for a character to get out of a seat. When a player jumps, they are removed from the seat. However this can also be done manually by destroying the seat weld, for example:

```lua
seat:FindFirstChild("SeatWeld"):Destroy()
```

Note seats have a cooldown (currently 3 seconds) that is on a per-character per-seat basis. This means once a character has gotten out of a seat they cannot sit back on the same seat for 3 seconds. This cooldown behavior may change and should not be relied upon by developers.

### What can Seats be used for?

Seats have a diverse range of uses, ranging from the obvious to the more unconventional.

- Creating chairs or benches without the need for any programming
- Allowing characters to ‘sit’ in moving objects such as vehicles without getting flung around
- Creating interfaces that are controlled by the character in the seat using the `Seat/Occupant` property */

/** SpawnLocations, or “spawns” determine where a `Player` respawns when they die. They can be configured to allow only certain players to use each spawn, using `Team|Teams`. They also control how `ForceField|ForceFields` are set up for newly-spawned players.

SpawnLocations can be used as checkpoints, such as in an obstacle course, using the `SpawnLocation/AllowTeamChangeOnTouch` property, so that when a player touches it, they will change teams to the SpawnLocation’s team. In this case, only the first `Team` should have `Team/AutoAssignable` set to true, else players will not start at the first checkpoint.

Note if a SpawnLocation is added to the `Workspace` in Studio with `SpawnLocation/Neutral` set to false a Team will be created corresponding to `SpawnLocation/TeamColor` if it does not already exist. This behavior does not occur when spawns are created in-game using a `Script` or if the properties of the SpawnLocation are changed after already being added. It is recommended that developers always set up their teams manually and not rely on this behavior.

/** MeshParts are a form of `BasePart` that includes a physically simulated custom mesh. Unlike with other mesh classes, such as `SpecialMesh` and `BlockMesh`, they are not parented to a `BasePart` but rather behave as a `BasePart` in their own right.

### How do I use MeshParts

The mesh and texture of a MeshPart are determined by the `MeshPart/MeshId` and `MeshPart/TextureID` properties. For more information on how to use MeshParts please see `Articles/Mesh Parts|here`.

### SpecialMesh or MeshPart?

There are currently two ways of using a developer created mesh. They are using a `SpecialMesh` with the `SpecialMesh/FileType` set to ‘FileMesh’, or by using a MeshPart. Although, on the whole, the MeshPart object has superseded the SpecialMesh there are some differences developers should be aware of.

- `BasePart/Material` displays correctly on the mesh when using a MeshPart and not when using a `SpecialMesh`
- MeshParts include the `MeshPart/CollisionFidelity` property, meaning the collision model of a MeshPart can be set to resemble the geometry of the mesh. The `SpecialMesh` object by contrast, uses the parent `BasePart`s collision model
- The mesh of a MeshPart scales on all axis depending on the `BasePart/Size` property of the MeshPart, the mesh of a `SpecialMesh` does not
- The `SpecialMesh` object includes the `DataModelMesh/Offset` and `DataModelMesh/Scale` properties whereas MeshParts do not
- The `DataModelMesh/MeshId` property of a `SpecialMesh` can be changed by a `Script` or `LocalScript` during runtime. The `MeshPart/MeshId` property of a MeshPart can not

In most, but not all cases, using a MeshPart is more suitable. As MeshParts are a relatively new feature however, developers should expect some of the above behaviour to change. */

Note, although the `MeshPart/MeshId` property cannot be changed during runtime, the texture can.

### How can I change the texture of a mesh?

Using the TextureId property, the texture of a mesh can be changed without having to reupload the mesh. To do this, a new image will need to be uploaded to Roblox with the desired texture. The original texture image file can be obtained by exporting the mesh using the ‘Export Selection’ option in Roblox Studio. The image file will be saved alongside the exported .obj file.

The new texture can then be re-uploaded to Roblox as a Decal and its content ID can be applied to the mesh using the TextureId property.

### How can I make a textured mesh?

A mesh can only be textured if the mesh has been UV mapped. UV mapping refers to the practice of projecting a texture map onto a mesh. This cannot be done using Roblox Studio and has to be done using an external 3D modelling application such as [Blender](). */

When not storing collections of `BasePart`s it is recommended that developers use the `Folder` object, as they will not benefit from the additional functionality Models provide.

Models have a wide range of applications, including being used for Roblox Player Characters. They also have a number of unique behaviors that are important to keep in mind when using them:

- When a `Humanoid` and a `Part` named “Head” are parented under a model, a name-tag GUI will appear with the name of the model.

- If a `Part`'s position on the Y axis hits the `Workspace/FallenPartsDestroyHeight` value, and it was the last object inside of a Model, the Model will be destroyed as well. */

/** The Workspace is the service in which any objects that are to be rendered in the 3D world exist. Objects not descending from Workspace will not be rendered or physically interact with the world.

### What does the Workspace do?

The core job of the Workspace is to hold objects that exist in the 3D world, `BasePart|BaseParts` and `Attachment|Attachments`. Whilst such objects are descendant of Workspace, they will be active. For BaseParts this means they will be rendered, and physically interact with other parts and the world. For `Attachment`s this means objects adorned to them, such as `ParticleEmitter|ParticleEmitters`, `Beam|Beams` and `BillboardGui|BillboardGuis` will render.

Understanding this behavior is important, as it means objects can be removed from the Workspace when they are not needed. For example, map `Model|Models` can be removed from the `Workspace` when a different map is being played on. Objects that are not immediately needed in the Workspace are generally stored in `ReplicatedStorage` or `ServerStorage`.

In its role as the holder of active 3D objects, Workspace includes a number of useful functions related to parts, their positions and joints between them. Commonly used are the Workspace’s raycasting functions, such as `Workspace/FindPartOnRay`.

### Accessing the Workspace

The Workspace can be accessed several ways, all of which are valid.

```lua
workspace -- a global variable
game.Workspace -- a property of the DataModel
game:GetService("Workspace") -- workspace is a service
```

### Notes

- Objects that require adornment, such as `ParticleEmitter`s and `BillboardGui`s will be adorned to the *0, 0, 0* position when adorned to the Workspace (parented to it without an adornee otherwise being set)
- The `Model/MakeJoints` and `Model/BreakJoints` functions inherited from the `Model` class are overridden by the Workspace’s own `Workspace/MakeJoints` and `Workspace/BreakJoints` functions, which can only be used in plugins
- It is impossible to delete the Workspace
- The Workspace will also clean up `BasePart`s that fall beneath `Workspace/FallenPartsDestroyHeight`
- A client’s current `Camera` object can be accessed using the `Workspace/CurrentCamera` property
- The `Terrain` object can be accessed using the `Workspace/Terrain` property */

	AllowThirdPartySales: boolean;
	/** The `Camera` object being used by the local player.

### How to use CurrentCamera

This property can be set. When it is set, all other `Camera` objects in the `Workspace` are destroyed, including the previous CurrentCamera. If this property is set to nil, or the CurrentCamera is otherwise destroyed, a new `Camera` will be created and assigned. Developers should avoid setting this property to nil or destroying the CurrentCamera however as it can have unintended consequences.

When looking for a client’s `Camera` object, developers should use this property rather than looking for a child of `Workspace` named ‘Camera’.

### What can be done with CurrentCamera

Accessing a client’s current `Camera` object brings a range of uses.

- Manipulating the viewport using the `Camera` functions
- Bbjects parented to the `Camera` will not replicate to the server, regardless of what `Workspace/FilteringEnabled` is set to. Prior to `Workspace/FilteringEnabled`, this was the main way to render `BasePart`s on one client only.

Below is an example of how this property can be used to access the `Camera` object and increase its `Camera/FieldOfView`.

```lua
workspace.CurrentCamera.FieldOfView = 100
``` */
	CurrentCamera?: Camera;

Despite the title, this value is currently not ‘Distributed’ across the client and the server. Instead, on the server it represents how long the server has been running. On the client, it represents how long the client has been connected to the server.

Developers should not rely on the above behavior, and it is possible this property will be synchronized across clients and the server in the future.

Those looking for the time since the program started running should use the ‘time’ function instead. See below for a comparison between DistributedGameTime and its alternatives.

![Parts being destroyed at the FallenPartsDestroyHeight](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b65c33eba048a343db86bf8/FallenPartsDestroyHeight.gif)

### What happens to falling parts?

For performance reasons, Roblox automatically destroys (using `Instance/Destroy`) parts that fall below this value. This is to prevent parts that have fallen off the map from continuing to fall forever.

If a part destroyed due to this behavior is the last part in a model, then that \`model will also be destroyed. This applies to all model ancestors of the part.

This property can be read by scripts, but can only be set by plugins, the command bar or the properties window in Roblox Studio.

### Notes

- Developers should also use the `Debris` service to clean up parts that are no longer needed, but have not fallen off the map
- This property is clamped between -50,000 and 50,000. This is because `BasePart`s do not simulate or render properly at a great distance from the origin due to floating point inaccuracies */

	/** Warning! Experimental Mode has been discontinued, meaning this property will no longer take effect.

Determines whether changes made from the client will replicate to the server or not. When this property is disabled, the game is in ‘Experimental Mode’.

This property is not replicated, meaning it cannot be changed once the game has started. For this reason, developers should only set this property in Roblox Studio.

### What does FilteringEnabled do?

When FilteringEnabled is disabled, the place is in ‘Experimental Mode’. In ‘Experimental Mode’, changes made to the game on the client replicate back to the server. For some, this makes games simpler to make, but means exploiters can change nearly anything in the game (such as deleting the baseplate).

When FilteringEnabled is enabled, everything continues to replicate from the server to the client (with a few exceptions such as `ServerStorage` and `ServerScriptStorage`). However, actions made by the client will no longer freely replicate to the server. Instead, `RemoteEvent`s and `RemoteFunction`s need to be used by the client to ‘request’ the server preforms certain actions on its behalf.

### What are the exceptions to FilteringEnabled?

Whilst FilteringEnabled prevents almost everything from replicating from the client to the server, there are some exceptions.

- Some properties on the local `Humanoid`
- `Sound` playback, when `SoundService/RespectFilteringEnabled` is set to false
- `ClickDetector` input events
- `AnimationTrack` playback
- Physics simulated on `BasePart`s which the client has `Articles/Network Ownership — Making physics smoother!|network ownership` of

### Is FilteringEnabled more secure?

Enabling FilteringEnabled is the best way of restricting exploiters from ruining your games. When it is enabled, with a few exceptions, changes made by clients will not replicate to the server (and therefore will not replicate to other clients). This means, if your game is properly designed, exploiters will find it much harder to operate in your game.

Enabling FilteringEnabled however, has implications on a game’s design that developers must consider. Before using it, it is highly recommended developers familiarize themselves on the following topics:

- `Articles/Experimental Mode|Experimental Mode` A brief introduction to the client-server model
- `Articles/Building Games with Experimental Mode Off|Building games with Experimental Mode off` How to approach building a game with FilteringEnabled
- [Converting Experimental Mode games](https://developer.roblox.com/articles/Converting-From-Experimental-Mode) Converting a game to use FilteringEnabled
- [Game Security](https://developer.roblox.com/articles/Game-Security) How to use FilteringEnabled to improve the security of your game */

	/** Whether network streaming is enabled for the place or not.

This property is not replicated, and therefore cannot be changed once the game has started. For this reason, it is advised it is set in Roblox Studio.

### What is network streaming?

Streaming is an opt-in feature builders can enable for their places. It’ll allow places to have more `BasePart`s, faster join times, and allow more games to run on less powerful hardware. It does this by allowing games to be played whilst objects are still being downloaded, and removing objects that are no longer needed.

The downside of network streaming is it means the client can no longer rely on specific objects being available. Developers should not enable StreamingEnabled unless they understand its implications and have put processes in place to manage them. For example, `LocalScript`s may have to use `Instance/WaitForChild` in order to access parts of the game. */

This property, like `Workspace/CurrentCamera`, ensures that developers to not inadvertently index a descendant of `Workspace` named ‘Terrain’ when looking for a game’s `Terrain` object. Without this property, developers would need to use the `Instance/FindFirstChildOfClass` function.

```lua

	/** FindPartOnRay uses [raycasting](https://developer.roblox.com/articles/Raycasting) to find the first `BasePart` intersecting with a given `DataType/Ray`. This function returns the position of intersection, the surface normal of the intersecting `BasePart` at the point of intersection, and the `BasePart`'s `BasePart/Material`.

```lua
local character = game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character
-- Get the head
local head = character:FindFirstChild("Head")
-- Build a ray in the direction the head is facing
local origin = head.Position
local lookDirection = head.CFrame.lookVector

-- Raycast, ignoring the player's character
local part, hitPosition = workspace:FindPartOnRay(ray, character)
if part then
	print("Hit part: " .. part:GetFullName())
else
	print("Did not hit part")
end
```

The `terrainCellsAreCubes` and `ignoreWater` parameters determine whether `Terrain` cells should be treated as cubes or not, and whether water should be ignored or not.

If the `ignoreDescendantsInstance` parameter is provided, the raycasting calculation will ignore the given object and all of its descendants. It behaves similar to the `Mouse/TargetFilter` property.

In order to white-list or ignore multiple objects and their descendants, use these variants: `Workspace/FindPartOnRayWithWhitelist|FindPartOnRayWithWhitelist` and `Workspace/FindPartOnRayWithIgnoreList|FindPartOnRayWithIgnoreList`.

### Notes

- Theoretically, a ray extends infinitely in one direction. However, the max length of the direction vector on Roblox is 5000 studs
- The length of the direction vector is important - parts further away than its length will not be tested
- If the ray does not intersect a part, the return values will be nil and the point at the end of the ray, respectively
- Parts that are in a `PhysicsService/SetPartCollisionGroup|collision group` that does not collide with the “Default” collision group are ignored implicitly

The optional ignoreDescendentsInstance parameter can be used to specify a specific instance for whom itself and all of its descendants should be ignored by this function.

### How do Region3 checks work?

Checking if a part overlaps a `DataType/Region3` is not a simple process. It actually is time consuming and complicated. Instead it checks if parts are roughly in the same area. When this function is called, it figures out which voxels contain the `DataType/Region3`. It then figures out which parts might be in those voxels. It does this by comparing the axis-aligned bounding box (sometimes called the AABB) of the part with the voxels. The axis-aligned bounding box can be seen in Roblox Studio when a part is selected.

This means that the area that is inspected by the function may be larger than the `DataType/Region3`. For this reason it is recommended to make sure that the `DataType/Region3` is on the voxel grid. The best way to do this is by setting the coordinates of the `DataType/Region3` to multiples of 4 (since voxels are 4 x 4 x 4 studs).

This method is a fairly quick and easy way to see if parts are in a general area. If a game needs to know if parts are exactly in an area, then `BasePart/GetTouchingParts` should be used. There is a higher cost to using `BasePart/GetTouchingParts` since a part is needed in the `Workspace` and the function takes more time to run. */

### Sleeping vs Awake Parts

In order to ensure good performance, Roblox sets `BaseParts` in which physics are not being applied to a ‘sleeping’ state. `BasePart`s with `BasePart/Anchored` set to true, for example, will always be sleeping as physics does not apply to them. When a force is applied to an non anchored `BasePart`, an ‘awake’ state will be applied. Whilst a `BasePart` is awake the Roblox physics engine will perform continuous calculations to ensure physical forces interact correctly with the part. Once the `BasePart` is no longer subject to physical forces, it will revert to a ‘sleeping’ state. */

This function can be used to determine whether, and to what degree, physics throttling is occurring.

### What is physics throttling?

Physics throttling occurs when the physics engine detects it cannot keep up with the game in realtime. When physics is being throttled, it will update less frequently causing `BasePart`s to appear to move slower.

Without throttling, the physics simulation would fall further behind out of sync with the game. This can lead to lower frame rates and other undesirable behavior.

Objects associated with `Humanoid`s are exempt from physics throttling.

See also `Workspace/SetPhysicsThrottleEnabled`.

### Demonstrating physics throttling

Developers should always avoid creating places that overload the physics engine, as it leads to sub-par experience for players. Those wishing to simulate physics throttling for research purposes however, need only create a lot of `Part`s very quickly.

```lua
local i = 0
while true do
	i = i + 1
	if i % 5 == 0 then
		wait()
	end
	local part = Instance.new("Part", workspace)
end
``` */

	/** Returns the number of frames per second that physics is currently being simulated at.

### Using GetRealPhysicsFPS to combat exploiters

A common use of this function is to detect if exploiters are increasing their local physics frame rate to move faster. This is generally done by comparing the result returned by a client’s GetRealPhysicsFPS to a maximum that will not be breached in normal circumstances (usually 65 or 70). If this limit is breached, developers can use the `Player/Kick` function to remove that `Player` from the game. It is important to remember that, although this practice may be effective sometimes, client-side anti-exploiter measures are never 100% reliable. */
	GetRealPhysicsFPS(): number;

/** A ParticleEmitter allows for the creation of [particle systems](). is a special effect object that emits customizable 2D billboard particles into the world. On Roblox, a particle is a 2D image rendered in the world so that it always always face the camera, much like a `BillboardGui` with a single `ImageLabel` in it.

![A ParticleEmitter with default settings in a Part with default settings](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt7bc5555538e06faa/ParticleEmitter.png)

ParticleEmitter must be parented to a `BasePart` (such as a `Part`) or an `Attachment` within such a part. Particles spawn randomly in the **bounding box** of its parent part (for attachments, this is a single point). Particles from a single emitter will render so long as this condition is met; setting a ParticleEmitter’s `Instance/Parent` to nil will remove all particles instantly, like how `ParticleEmitter/Clear` works. If an emitter is `ParticleEmitter/Enabled` and has a nonzero `ParticleEmitter/Rate`, it will emit particles on its own. Finer control on the number of particles can be accomplished using `ParticleEmitter/Emit`.

Roblox provides several pre-made particle effect objects - `Fire`, `Smoke` and `Sparkles`. They behave similarly to a ParticleEmitter, but they are not as customizable. They also lack certain particle-controlling methods: `ParticleEmitter/Emit` and `ParticleEmitter/Clear`. An `Explosion` also uses particles, but provides little-to-no control with regards to how the effect looks.

### How to Insert a ParticleEmitter

In Studio, a ParticleEmitter can be inserted in several ways:

- Using the “Effects” drop-down (Model tab)
- From the Advanced Objects window (In the model tab, or CTRL+I)
- The add menu within the Explorer window
- Using the Command bar, run `Instance.new("ParticleEmitter", workspace)`
- If you find you are inserting ParticleEmitters often, you can add a ParticleEmitter button to the Quick Access toolbar

![Drop-down Efffects menu for inserting a ParticleEmitter](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt14277a5a3c807db6/ParticleEmitter_Insertion.png)![AdvancedObjects window insertion]()![Explorer window insertion]() */
interface ParticleEmitter extends RbxInternalInstance {
	/** The string name of this Instance's most derived class. */
	readonly ClassName: "ParticleEmitter";
	/** The Acceleration property determines how particles `ParticleEmitter/Speed` changes over the particle’s lifetime. It is defined using a `DataType/Vector3` to determine the acceleration on the global X/Y/Z axes. It is measured in studs per second squared. When changed, this property affects all particles emit by the emitter, both current and future particles.

Pictured below are two default ParticleEmitters. The foreground (right) emitter has an Acceleration on the positive-X axis, causing the path of the particles to bend in that direction.

![An image of two default ParticleEmitters, wherein the foreground emitter has a +X Acceleration](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltaeb3393ea3390868/ParticleEmitter_Acceleration.png)

Acceleration will slow particles down if the vector points in the opposite `ParticleEmitter/EmissionDirection` in which particles are emitted. Otherwise, it will speed them up. You can use `ParticleEmitter/Drag` to slow particles down no matter what direction they travel.

Acceleration is most often used to apply a gravity effect to particles (try a value of (0, -3, 0) for this). You can also use small values on the X/Z axes to make it look like particles are being blown away by wind. If you emit a bubble particle downwards, you could use an acceleration of (0, 5, 0) to cause the bubbles to decelerate and then float back upwards. */
	Acceleration: Vector3;
	/** The Color property determines the color of all particles active in an emitter’s system. The color is applied to the `ParticleEmitter/Texture` when rendering, and uses the texture alpha along with the `ParticleEmitter/Transparency`. If a particle has a `ParticleEmitter/LightEmission` of greater than 0, darker colors will make particles appear more transparent. Below, two default `ParticleEmitter` are pictured, except the right emitter uses a Color from yellow to cyan.

![Two default ParticleEmitters, except the right has a Color from Yellow to Cyan](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt07a957ff7394b365/ParticleEmitter_Color.png)

Note that the default `ParticleEmitter/Lifetime` is 5 to 10 seconds, so some particles next to each other have small variations in color due to the variations in individual particle lifetime.

A particle’s present color is determined by linearly interpolating on this ColorSequence using the particle’s age and the particle’s total lifetime. For example, if a particle spawned 2 seconds ago and has a 4 second lifetime, the color will be whatever is 50% of the way through the `DataType/ColorSequence`.

Changing this property applies changes to all particles present in the system. This is because the color of a particle is determined using its present lifetime and this ColorSequence (the ColorSequence when the particle was emit is not stored on a per-particle basis). */
	Color: ColorSequence;
	/** The Drag property determines the rate in seconds at which individual particles will lose half their speed via exponential decay. Pictured below are two identical default ParticleEmitters, except that the right has a Drag value of 0.25.

![Animation of drag on a ParticleEmitter](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt9a58d2b5746274de/ParticleEmitter_Drag.gif)

Drag is applied by scaling the expected velocity (from `ParticleEmitter/Speed` and any velocity inherited from the parent from `ParticleEmitter/VelocityInheritance`) by the following formula: `2 ^ (elapsedTime * -drag)`, where `elapsedTime` is the time since the particle was emit. Consequently, setting Drag to a negative value will cause particles’ velocities to grow exponentially.

Warning: if Drag is set to a sufficiently negative value, this can cause all particles emit by the emitter to completely disappear. Be careful when setting this property lower than -100. */
	Drag: number;
	/** The EmissionDirection property determines the face (`Enum/NormalId`) of the parent object towards which particles will be emit. By default, this is the top (+Y) direction. A negative `ParticleEmitter/Speed` will emit in the opposite direction. `ParticleEmitter/SpreadAngle` will further vary the emission direction. If a `ParticleEmitter` is added to an `Attachment`, which has a direction, the the Attachment itself can be rotated (`Attachment/Orientation`) instead of using this property. Below are pictured two ParticleEmitters which are otherwise the same, except the left has an EmissionDirection of Top (+Y, default) and the right uses Front (-Z).

![Two identical ParticleEmitters except with differing EmissionDirection (left is Top, right is Front)](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt529991a1b0fa24f4/ParticleEmitter_EmissionDirection.png) */
	EmissionDirection: Enum.NormalId;
	/** The Enabled property determines whether a `ParticleEmitter` should emit partciles according to its `ParticleEmitter/Rate`. Setting Enabled to false will halt further particles from spawning; any existing particles will remain until they expire. This property is useful when you have a pre-made particle effect that you want to remain disabled until you need it to emit particles.

If you want no particles to render, you should call `ParticleEmitter/Clear` to clear any existing particles. You can use `ParticleEmitter/Emit` on disabled `ParticleEmitter`s and they will still emit and render particles. */
	Enabled: boolean;
	/** The Lifetime property defines the maximum and minimum ages a newly emit particle will. When a particle is emit, a random lifetime is chosen uniformly. Lifetimes are stored on a per-particle basis, so if this value is changed, existing particles will stay “alive” until their randomly chosen lifetime is lived. The bounds for this property should be in the range [0, 20]. By default, `ParticleEmitter`s will have a lifetime of 5 to 10 seconds. A lifetime of 0 will prevent particles from being emit in the first place.

it is important to pick a sensible Lifetime and `ParticleEmitter/Rate` so that you don’t have too many particles being rendered at once. Long lifetimes and high emission rates are a quick way to cause performance issues. If you need many particles, pick a balance of lifetime and rate. To instantly remove any presently emit particles (perhaps ones with absurdly long lifetimes), you can call `ParticleEmitter/Clear`. */
	Lifetime: NumberRange;
	/** The LightEmission property determines the blending of the `ParticleEmitter/Texture`'s colors with the colors behind them. It should be set on the range [0, 1]. A value of 0 uses normal blending modes, and a value of 1 will use additive blending. The value of the additive blending is determined by this property. When changed, this property instantly affects all particles owned by the emitter, both current and future particles.

Pictured below are two default ParticleEmitters. The right one has its LightEmission set to 1, so the particles appear brighter due to the additive blending when they overlap.

![Two default ParticleEmitters; the right one has a LightEmission of 1](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltfaa542eee7781432/ParticleEmitter_LightEmission.png)

When set to 1, only additive blending is used. As such, choosing a suitable `ParticleEmitter/Texture` is necessary. Below is an example texture that is suitable for such a ParticleEmitter.

![A gray-scale image suitable as a particle Texture](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltf793b94e42b0b6bf/aura.png)

This property should not be confused with `ParticleEmitter/LightInfluence`, which determines how particles are affected by environment light. This property does not cause particles to light the environment around them. To do that, consider using a `PointLight`. */
	LightEmission: number;
	/** The LightInfluence property determines how much environment light affects the color of individual particles when they are rendered. It must be in the range [0, 1]; behavior of values outside of this range are not defined. At 0, particles are not influenced by light at all (they retain full brightness), and at 1 particles are fully influenced by light (in complete darkness, particles will be black).

Pictured below are three default ParticleEmitters [at night]() with varing LightInfluence. There is a `PointLight` with sufficient `PointLight/Brightness` and `PointLight/Range` to light the particles near to their parent parts. Take note of how each particle is affected by the lack of light close to the end of their lifetime.

	LockedToPart: boolean;
	/** The Rate property determines how many particles are `ParticleEmitter/Emit` emit per second while the `ParticleEmitter` is `ParticleEmitter/Enabled`. It is the inverse of frequency - a Rate of 5 means that a particle will be emit every `1/5 = 0.2` seconds. When changed, this property will have no affect on any already emit particles.

it is important to pick a sensible `ParticleEmitter/Lifetime` and Rate so that you don’t have too many particles being rendered at once. Long lifetimes and high emission rates are a quick way to cause performance issues. If you need many particles, pick a balance of lifetime and rate. To instantly remove any presently emit particles (perhaps ones with absurdly long lifetimes), you can call `ParticleEmitter/Clear`. */
	Rate: number;
	/** The RotSpeed property determines a random range of angular speeds that newly emit particles will have. A random angular speed is chosen upon emission, so changing this property will not affect already emit particles. This property, along with `ParticleEmitter/Rotation` affect the angle of the rendered particle image. This property is a `DataType/NumberRange` measured in degrees per second.

Below is an animation of two default `ParticleEmitter`s. The right has a nonzero RotSpeed, so its particles rotate as they move through the world.

![Two default ParticleEmitters; the right emitter has a RotSpeed applied](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltfe2427c2a9f0f3ad/ParticleEmitter_RotSpeed.gif)

Using a spiral as a `ParticleEmitter/Texture` like the one below, you can create some quite interesting particle effects:

![A swirl texture](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltc50865c165e13d07/ParticleEmitter_RotSpeed2_swirl.gif)![A portal effect using RotSpeed and a Swirl texture]()

Particles with very high angular speeds can appear to rotate slower or not at all - this is because the angle of rotation is synchronized with the software render speed. In other words, if the particle is rotating at exactly 360 degrees every frame, there will be no apparent change in rotation. */
	RotSpeed: NumberRange;
	/** The Rotation property determines the angle at which new particles are emit. It is a `DataType/NumberRange` measured in degrees. Positive values are in the clockwise direction. This property is often set to [0, 360] to provide a completely random rotation to new particles. `ParticleEmitter/RotSpeed` also influences the rotation of a particle over its lifetime. Finally, this property is useful for correcting any `ParticleEmitter/Texture`s that aren’t at the desired orientation.

Pictured below are two default ParticleEmitters, except that the right has a Rotation of 22.5. Note how the particles on the left are straight up, and the right are tilted slightly.

![Two default ParticleEmitters with varying Rotations](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltb0b7b9f3f01688b2/ParticleEmitter_Rotation.png)

Changes to this value only affect new particles; existing particles will maintain the rotation at which they were originally emitted. */
	Rotation: NumberRange;
	/** The Size property determines the world size in studs of all active particles over their individual lifetimes. This property represents the dimensions of the square `ParticleEmitter/Texture` for each particle. It is a `DataType/NumberSequence` that works similar to `ParticleEmitter/Transparency` and `ParticleEmitter/Color`.

Below is an animation of two default `ParticleEmitter` where the right one has a Size of 0 to 2. Note how the particles grow over their lifetime.

![Animation of two default ParticleEmitters; the right one has a Size of 0 to 2](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt908c9ca9b5bddace/ParticleEmitter_Size.gif)

A particle’s present size is determined by linearly interpolating on this NumberSequence using the particle’s age and the particle’s total lifetime. For example, if a particle spawned 2 seconds ago and has a 4 second lifetime, the size will be whatever is 50% of the way through the `DataType/NumberSequence`. For any `DataType/NumberSequenceKeypoint` with a nonzero envelop value, a random value in the envelop range is chosen for each keypoint for each particle when it spawns.

Changing this property applies changes to all particles present in the system. This is because the size of a particle is determined using its present lifetime and this NumberSequence (the Size at the time the particle was emit is not stored on a per-particle basis).

### Design Note

When designing particle effects, size is probably the most important of all properties. Too large or too subtle can ruin a particle effect! The first thing you should do is decide how you want particles to enter and exit view - fade in/out, or grow/shrink from size 0? The choice is yours - start with a size NumberSequence from 0 to 3 or the reverse and go from there. */
	Size: NumberSequence;
	/** The Speed property determines the random range of velocities that newly emit particles may have. It is measured in studs per second using a `DataType/NumberRange`. The velocity is chosen upon emission, and is applied in the `ParticleEmitter/EmissionDirection`. Negative speed values will cause particles to travel in reverse.

Below is an animation of two default `ParticleEmitter`s; the left has the default Speed of 5. The right one has the Speed range set to [20, 20], so its particles emit at a constant speed of 20.

![Two default ParticleEmitters, the right has a speed of 20.](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blte13fc189c250bd2b/ParticleEmitter_Speed.gif)

`ParticleEmitter/VelocityInheritance`, `ParticleEmitter/Acceleration` and `ParticleEmitter/Drag` will affect a particle’s speed over its lifetime. Changing Speed will not affect already existing particles - they will retain whatever speed they have already. */
	Speed: NumberRange;
	/** The SpreadAngle property determines the random angles that a particle may be emit. On emission, a random angle is selected uniformly using the range defined by SpreadAngle. For example, if the `ParticleEmitter/EmissionDirection` is Top (+Y), then this `DataType/Vector2` describes the size of the random angle spread on the X/Z axes, in degrees. The particle is given a velocity based on the `ParticleEmitter/Speed` in the chosen direction.

Below is an animation of two default ParticleEmitters. The foreground (closer) emitter has one of its SpreadAngle axes set to 90 degrees, so particles are emit randomly in an arc.

	/** The Transparency property determines the transparency in studs of all active particles over their individual lifetimes. It works similar to `ParticleEmitter/Size` in how it affects particles over time. In terms of rendering, it works like the `BasePart/Transparency` of a part.

Pictured below are two default `ParticleEmitter`s. The right emitter has a Transparency set to a `DataType/NumberSequence` that interpolates from 0 to 1.

For any `DataType/NumberSequenceKeypoint` with a nonzero envelop value, a random value in the envelop range is chosen for each keypoint for each particle when it spawns.

Changing this property applies changes to all particles present in the system. This is because the transparency of a particle is determined using its present lifetime and this `NumberSequence` (the Transparency at the time the particle was emit is not stored on a per-particle basis). */
	Transparency: NumberSequence;
	/** The VelocityInheritance property determines how much of the parent part’s `BasePart/Velocity` is inherited by particles when they are emitted. A value of 0 means that no velocity is inherited, and a value of 1 means the particle will have the exact same speed as the parent `BasePart`.

### Solver Variations

The behavior of this property varies depending on whether Roblox's physics engine is using the *PGS Physics Solver*, or the *Spring Physics Solver*.

 This is controlled by the \`Workspace\`'s \`Workspace/PGSPhysicsSolverEnabled\` property.

### Spring Physics Solver

When \`Workspace/PGSPhysicsSolverEnabled\` is set to false, the contact points are color coded as listed below.

, and the length of the arrow will always be 1 stud.

There are no special conditions tracked, because the PGS solver does not keep specific lookup tables for the states listed in the Spring Solver.

### First-person

In first-person mode, the player’s camera is zoomed all the way in. Unless there is a visible GUI present with the `/GuiButton/Modal` property set to *true*, the mouse will be locked and the user’s camera will turn as the mouse moves.

- You may right-click and drag to rotate your camera, or use the arrow keys at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.
- When you move your mouse, your camera does not change (unless you move the mouse to the end of the screen).
- When you press any of the arrow keys, the user’s character will face in the corresponding arrow key’s direction.
- You can zoom in and out freely.

Use the `Player/CharacterAdded` event to detect when a player’s character properly loads, and the `Player/CharacterRemoving` event to detect when the character is about to despawn. Avoid using `Instance/GetPropertyChangedSignal` on this property.

### Notes

LocalScripts that are cloned from `StarterGui` or `StarterPack` into a player’s `Backpack` or `PlayerGui` are often run before the old Character model is deleted. Player.Character still refers to a model, but that model’s parent is nil and it is has been destroyed. Because of this, if the Character already exists, you should check to make sure that the Character’s parent is not nil before using it.

So if you’re writing a `LocalScript`, do this:

```lua
local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer
local character = player.Character
if not character or not character.Parent then
    character = player.CharacterAdded:wait()
end
```

But from the server it’s fine to do this:

```lua
if player.Character then
	-- do something
end
```

Or if you want to wait until the character respawns from a server `Script`:

```lua
local character = player.Character or player.CharacterAdded:wait()
``` */

When mouse lock is enabled, the player’s cursor is locked to the center of the screen. Moving the mouse will orbit the camera around the player’s `Player/Character|character`, and character will face the same direction as the `Camera|camera`.

### Alternatives to RespawnLocation

- A `Player` will spawn from `SpawnLocation|SpawnLocations` belonging to their team. In some cases it may be simpler to change the `Player|Player's` `Player/Team` instead. This method also allows the `Player` to respawn from multiple `SpawnLocation|SpawnLocations`.

This can be used alongside the `Player/CharacterRemoving` event, which fires right before a player’s character is about to be removed, typically after death. As such, both of these event can potentially fire many times as players die then respawn in a place. If you want to detect when a player joins or leaves the game, you can use the `Players/PlayerAdded` and `Players/PlayerRemoving` events instead.

end

	/** The Chatted event fires when a `Player` types a message and presses enter in Roblox’s provided chat bar. This is done using some Lua bindings by the default chat script. You can prevent players from chatting by using `StarterGui/SetCoreGuiEnabled` and disabling the Chat `Enum/CoreGuiType`.

### Chat Commands

Using this event and some string manipulation functions like `string.sub` and `string.lower`, it is possible to create chat commands, even with arguments like player names. Usually, commands are prefixed such as `/heal PlayerName`. To check for a prefix in a string, use `string.sub` on the message to check a substring of the message: `string.sub(message, 1, 6) == "/heal "` (note the inclusion of the space) . Then, extract the rest of the command using `string.sub` again: `string.sub(message, 7)` will be equal to the player name. Check if that player exists, and if so, perform the command’s action (in this example, healing them). Check the code samples for examples of chat commands.

### Filtering

The message text fired with this event is **unfiltered**. If you are displaying player input like chat to other players in any form, it must be filtered using `Chat/FilterStringAsync`. Keep this in mind when creating your own chat systems; if your game does not properly filter chat it may have moderation action taken against it. */

When the game engine classifies a player as idle, this event is called after two minutes. After every check, if the player is still idled, the event will continue to fire until the check reveals the player is no longer idle.

### GetJoinData and TeleportData

If the teleport the `Player` arrived in the current place due to was initiated on a server (as opposed to a client) the `Player|Player’s` *teleportData* is included in the dictionary returned by this function.

This function can only be used to fetch *teleportData* on the server, to retrieve it on the client use `TeleportService/GetLocalPlayerTeleportData`.

In contrast to `TeleportService/GetLocalPlayerTeleportData`, this function provides a number of security checks to the *teleportData*:

- It is guaranteed to have been sent by a Roblox server in the last 48 hours
- It is guaranteed to have been sent with this `Player`
- The SourcePlaceId returned is guaranteed to be the place the data was sent from. This means you can verify the TeleportData came from an approved place

However, as this data is transmitted by the client, it not 100% secure. Although the user cannot modify this data it is possible for them to view it or insert data from a previous teleport.

Despite this, it is still appropriate for the secure transmission of [immutable data]() (data that can not be changed). For example, if the user has completed a level that cannot be uncompleted. Such data can be securely transmitted using this function avoiding the need to use up and wait for `GlobalDataStore|DataStore` requests when teleporting.

You should not use this function for data that can be changed. For example, the amount of in-game currency the user currently has. This is because GetJoinData cannot guarantee a malicious user is not transmitting data from a previous session. For data like this, you should rely on `GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores`.

As with all cases, you should implement proper server validation to ensure your game is secure. For more information see this article on `Articles/Game Security`. */

### Loading GUIs

When creating loading GUIs using `ReplicatedFirst`, sometimes a `LocalScript` may run before the `Players/LocalPlayer` is created and becomes available. In such cases, it is useful to yield until it is by using `Instance/GetPropertyChangedSignal`

```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local player = Players.LocalPlayer or Players:GetPropertyChangedSignal("LocalPlayer"):wait()
```

Note that this technique is not required for `LocalScript|LocalScripts` within in `StarterGui`, `StarterPlayerScripts` or `StarterCharacterScripts`, as these kinds of scripts only run if the `Player` object is already available. */

This property can be set from the place settings’ *Access* tab on the site. It cannot be set through `Script`s or `LocalScript`s in-game.

When a player press the Play button to join a game server, Roblox attempts to match that player to a server such that the player count will try not to exceed PreferredPlayers. If a friend (or friends) of the player are in a server that is not full, Roblox prioritizes that server instead.

### Example

There are 8 players in a server where the `Player/MaximumPlayers` is 10 and the PreferredPlayers is 8. A player presses the play button:

- If the player has **at least one friend** in the server, Roblox selects the already-existing server so the player can play with their friend.
- If the player has **no friends** in the server, a new server is started since the existing server has met the number of PreferredPlayers (the player could still join the server by manually selecting it or following another user). */

This can be used alongside the `Players/PlayerRemoving` event, which fires when a player is about to leave the game. For instance, if you would like print a message every time a new player joins or leaves the game:

```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
	print(player.Name .. " joined the game!")
end)

Players.PlayerRemoving:Connect(function(player)
	print(player.Name .. " left the game!")
end)
```

If you want to track when a player’s character is added or removed from the game, such as when a player respawns or dies, you can use the `Player/CharacterAdded` and `Player/CharacterRemoving` functions.

### Notes

- Up until recently, this event didn’t work on the client (in `Localscript`s), but this has been changed

- This event does not work as expected in *solo mode*, because the player is created before scripts that connect to PlayerAdded run. To handle this case, as well as cases in which the script is added into the game after a player enters, create an OnPlayerAdded function that you can call to handle a player’s entrance. */

This event fires before `Instance/ChildRemoved|ChildRemoved` does on `Players`, and behaves somewhat similarly to `Instance/DescendantRemoving`. Since event fires before the actual removal of a `Player`, this event is useful to store player data using a `GlobalDataStore`.

This can be used alongside the `Player/PlayerAdded` event, which fires when a player joins the game. For instance, if you would like print a message every time a new player joins or leaves the game:

```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

Players.PlayerAdded:Connect(function(player)
	print(player.Name + " joined the game!")
end)

Players.PlayerRemoving:Connect(function(player)
	print(player.Name + " left the game!")
end)

local function getPlayerByUserId(userId)
	for _, player in pairs(Players:GetPlayers()) do
		if player.UserId == userId then
			return player
		end
	end
end
```

This method is useful in finding the purchaser of a developer product using `MarketplaceService/ProcessReceipt`, which provides a table that includes the purchaser’s UserId and not a reference to the Player object itself. Most games will require a reference to the player in order to grant products. */

		if player.Character == character then
			return player
		end
	end
end
```

This method is often used when some event in player’s character fires (such as their `Humanoid` `Humanoid/Died|dying`). Such an event might not directly reference the Player object, but this method provides easy access. The inverse of this function can be described as getting the Character of a Player. To do this, simply access the Character property. */

local onPlayerAdded(player)
	print("Player: " .. player.Name)

/** A PluginToolbar is an object created by using the `Plugin/CreateToolbar` method. It is used to create `PluginToolbarButton`s using the `PluginToolbar/CreateButton|CreateButton` function. In general, it is good practice for a plugin to use **one and only one** uniquely named toolbar for all of its buttons. In Roblox Studio, toolbars are rendered under the Plugins tab.

![A screenshot of Roblox Studio's Plugins tab, rendering several PluginToolbars](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5c48e228da4c5b970f6efb58/PluginToolbar-light.png)

Pictured above are three PluginToolbars in Roblox Studio: Animations, Three Wise Monkeys and Localization. The center toolbar is a custom toolbar created by a plugin; the other toolbars are created by built-in Roblox Studio plugins.

### Example

The following code sample creates a basic toolbar with one button. It should be run as a Roblox Studio plugin, and not run as a `Script`.

```lua
local toolbar = plugin:CreateToolbar("Three Wise Monkeys")
local button = toolbar:CreateButton("Mizaru", "See No Evil", "rbxassetid://2778270261")
``` */
interface PluginToolbar extends RbxInternalInstance {
	/** The string name of this Instance's most derived class. */
	readonly ClassName: "PluginToolbar";
}

/** A PluginToolbarButton is an object created by the `PluginToolbar/CreateButton` function. It allows the user to initiate a single, one-off action in Roblox Studio through the `PluginToolbarButton/Click|Click` event. Pictured below are three PluginToolbarButtons. From left to right: the default, hover and pressed states. The hovered button in the center shows tooltip text, which is the 2nd argument passed to `PluginToolbar/CreateButton`.

![Three PluginToolbarButtons rendered on a PluginToolbar titled "Three Wise Monkeys"](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5c48e310f8a426690c84250e/PluginToolbarButton-light.png)

### Behavior

When pressed, the `PluginToolbarButton/Click|Click` event fires. A button will also remain in the pressed state, which may be set manually using `PluginToolbarButton/SetActive|SetActive`. Upon plugin activation (`Plugin/Activate`), buttons in all other `PluginToolbar`s will be toggled off. If all buttons in a toolbar are off, the toolbar’s plugin is deactivated (`Plugin/Deactivate`).

When the game viewport is not visible, buttons will be disabled as if their `PluginToolbarButton/Enabled|Enabled` property were false. Disabled buttons are desaturated and do not respond to user clicks. By setting `PluginToolbarButton/ClickableWhenViewportHidden|ClickableWhenViewportHidden` to true, you can allow plugin buttons to remain clickable (such as during script editing).

- Prior to an update released in January 2019, this class was simply known as “Button”. This was changed to reduce confusion with similarly named in-game UI element classes, such as `TextButton`. */

/** A Pose holds the `CFrame` applied to the `Motor6D` connected to its associated `BasePart`. The part which is controlled depends on the name of the Pose.

Poses are the fundamental building blocks of animations and, with `Keyframes`, make up `KeyframeSequences`.

### Poses, joints and hierarchy

Although a Pose is assigned to a `BasePart` by name, the object manipulated during animation playback is actually the `Motor6D` connected to this part. Animation rigs branch out from the model’s root part through such joints.

As an example. In a R15 character rig the root part is the HumanoidRootPart. The LowerTorso is connected to the HumanoidRootPart by the a motor named ‘Root’. Therefore, the `CFrame` of a Pose named ‘LowerTorso’ in a `Keyframe` would be applied to the motor named ‘Root’, and not the LowerTorso itself.

Poses are arranged in a `Keyframe` based on joint hierarchy. This means, the Pose’s `CFrame` is applied to the motor connecting the part associated with the pose to the part associated with the pose’s parent. See below for a visual example of the structure of Poses on a R15 character.

![](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt2e767397c28fecda/KeyframeSequence_-_Copy.png)

### Pose CFrame

The Roblox animation system applies `Pose/CFrame` to the corresponding `Motor6D` by manipulating the relative transformation of the motor, the `Motor6D/Transform` property. The original `JointInstance/C1|C0` and `JointInstance/C1|C1` values are not changed. */

- **In** \- Interpolation will play forwards, default value for poses
- **Out** \- Interpolation will play in reverse, default value in animation edtior
- **InOut** \- Interpolation will play forwards, then reverse at the mid-point

Note, this property is a `Enum/PoseEasingDirection`, which despite sharing the same options is different to the `Enum/EasingDirection` used by other objects. Attempting to set this property to an `Enum/EasingDirection` value will produce an error.

\###Pose Interpolation

The `Pose/CFrame` of each `Pose` determines the `Motor6D/Transform` of the joint associated with the pose at the time of its parent `Keyframe`. It does not reach this value instantly, but interpolates from the previous pose applied to that joint (which may not necessarily be in the previous keyframe).

	/** The EasingStyle determines the ‘style’ of the interpolation. Along with `Pose/EasingDirection`, it determines how the joint will interpolate from this `Pose` to the subsequent `Pose` during animation playback.

\###Pose EasingStyle Values

- **Linear** \- Linear interpolation
- **Constant** \- Does not interpolate but snaps to the next pose. The point at which this occurs is determined by `Pose/EasingDirection`. - **In** \- Happens immediately
    - **Out** \- Happens at the time of the next pose
    - **InOut** \- Happens at the midpoint between poses

- **Elastic** \- Springs back and overshoots the target in an elastic manner
- **Cubic** \- Cubic interpolation, speed changes as target nears
- **Bounce** \- Bounces several times before reaching the target

/** ColorCorrectionEffect is a post-processing effect that can be used to adjust several color-related properties at once: `ColorCorrectionEffect/Saturation|Saturation`, `ColorCorrectionEffect/TintColor|TintColor`, `ColorCorrectionEffect/Brightness|Brightness` and `ColorCorrectionEffect/Contrast|Contrast`.

Like all `PostEffect` objects, objects of this kind should be parented to either the `Lighting` or the `Workspace/CurrentCamera` to work.

Multiple ColorCorrectionEffects can be applied at once, and they will compose their effects together.

/** RenderingTest is an internal testing utility used by Roblox engineers to do performance/regression tests on the rendering pipeline. It is expected to be parented inside of the `TestService`, and will run LocalScripts parented inside of it when the TestService is ran via `TestService/Run`.

![Selected RenderingTest](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b404eddcbdac88b0b7f2e4e/RenderingTest.png)

One of its more notable features is that, upon being selected in the Explorer, it draws an accurate wireframe of the Camera frustum, visualizing what a Camera would see in the RenderingTest’s configuration.

### Recording Test Results

When a RenderingTest is executed by the TestService, the `Workspace/CurrentCamera|CurrentCamera` of the `Workspace` has its properties updated so it mirrors the Camera configuration of the RenderingTest.

The recorded data is then sent as JSON with an HTTP-POST request to: `localhost:8001/api/v1/submit_test`.

For the RenderingTest to pass in Roblox Studio, the request expects the response to be the string `"passed"`. It will also acknowledge the strings `"failed"` or `"golden"` as a string response. */

/** A container whose contents are replicated to all clients (but not back to the server) first before anything else.

### What is ReplicatedFirst for?

ReplicatedFirst is most commonly used to store `LocalScript`s and other objects that are essential for the game’s start. As the contents of ReplicatedFirst replicate to the client before anything else in the game, it is ideal for creating loading GUIs or tutorials.

For objects that do not need to be replicated first, developers should use the `ReplicatedStorage` container instead.

### How can I use ReplicatedFirst?

`LocalScript`s placed within ReplicatedFirst will run. This means code for custom loading screens or other ReplicatedFirst uses can be ran at the earliest possible point.

There a number of key considerations developers need to remember when running `LocalScript`s in ReplicatedFirst.

- Its contents replicate before anything else in the game, meaning `LocalScript`s running in ReplicatedFirst will need to wait for any objects they require to replicate using `Instance/WaitForChild`
- Any objects that are to be used by a `LocalScript` in ReplicatedFirst should also be parented to ReplicatedFirst. Otherwise, they may replicate to the client late, yielding the script and negating the benefit of ReplicatedFirst.

ReplicatedFirst also includes the function `ReplicatedFirst/RemoveDefaultLoadingScreen`, which can be used to immediately remove the default Roblox loading screen. Note if any object has been placed in ReplicatedFirst, the default loading screen will remove after 5 seconds regardless if this function has been called or not. */

	/** The string name of this Instance's most derived class. */

	/** Immediately removes the default Roblox loading screen. Note if any object has been placed in `ReplicatedFirst`, the default loading screen will remove after 5 seconds regardless if this function has been called or not.

Developers should run this function from a `LocalScript` in `ReplicatedFirst`, as scripts in `ReplicatedFirst` will execute before anything else.

It is advised to not remove the default loading screen unless the developer wishes to display their own loading screen as an alternative. If the default screen is removed without replacement users will be able to see geometry loading in the background. */

/** Complex games often require a range of assets that are held in storage until they’re required. **ReplicatedStorage** is a container whose contents are replicated to all connected clients, allowing such objects to be stored until needed. ReplicatedStorage is also an ideal location for `RemoteFunction|RemoteFunctions` and `RemoteEvent|RemoteEvents` since they can be found on both the client and server.

Note these additional details about ReplicatedStorage:

- Objects descending from ReplicatedStorage can be accessed from a `Script` or `LocalScript` on both the server and client.
- Objects can be replicated to the client by parenting them to ReplicatedStorage:

- Although the client can access and modify ReplicatedStorage, these changes will not replicate to the server or other clients.
- `Script|Scripts` and `LocalScript|LocalScripts` will not run when they are parented to ReplicatedStorage, although `ModuleScript|ModuleScripts` contained within it can be accessed and executed. There are a number of alternative containers where client-side

 scripts will run, such as `StarterPlayerScripts` and `ReplicatedFirst`.

In addition, you can use `IsStudio` to add special behavior for in-studio testing.

`RunService` also provides events that help you manage time. `Stepped` and `Heartbeat` can be used for game logic while `RenderStepped` can be used for visual effects. These events fire with “delta time” values. `Stepped` also includes the total amount of time passed in a game. Correctly using the change in time values for game logic is important for changing values over time. As a general rule, multiply your change in time by the rate of change to get the amount a value should change in one frame. For example:

deltaPosition = speed * deltaTime

	/** The `BindToRenderStep` function binds a custom function to be called at a specific time during the render step. There are three main arguments for BindToRenderStep: `name`, `priority`, and `what function to call`.

As it is linked to the client’s rendering process, BindToRenderStep can only be called on the client.

### Name

The `name` parameter is a label for the binding, and can be used with `RunService/UnbindFromRenderStep` if the binding is no longer needed.

```lua
local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

local function functionToBind() end

-- Bind the function above to the binding named "tempBinding"
RunService:BindToRenderStep("tempBinding", 1, functionToBind)
-- Unbind the function bound to "tempBinding"
RunService:UnbindFromRenderStep("tempBinding")
```

### Priority

The `priority` of the binding is an integer, and determines when during the render step to call the custom function. The lower this number, the sooner the custom function will be called. If two bindings have the same priority the Roblox engine will randomly pick one to run first. The default Roblox control scripts run with these specific priorities:

- Player Input: 100
- Camera Controls: 200

 For convenience, the `Enum/RenderPriority` enum can be used to determine the integer value to set a binding. For example, to make a binding right before the default camera update, simply subtract 1 from the camera priority level.

> **Note:** When using Enum.RenderPriority, remember to use ***InlineCode.Value*** at the end of the desired enum. BindToRenderStep will not work if just the enum on its own is used.

```lua
local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

local function beforeCamera(delta)
	-- Code in here will run before the default Roblox camera script
end

RunService:BindToRenderStep("Before camera", Enum.RenderPriority.Camera.Value - 1, beforeCamera)
```

### Custom Function and Delta Time

The last argument of BindToRenderStep is the `custom function` to call. This function will be passed one parameter called deltaTime. ***DeltaTime*** shows how much time passed between the beginning of the previous render step and the beginning of the current render step.

> **Note:** All rendering updates will wait until the code in the render step finishes. Make sure that any code called by BindToRenderStep runs quickly and efficiently. If code in BindToRenderStep takes too long, then the game visuals will be choppy. */

If there is no bound function by the given name, this method raises an error. You can prevent such an error from being raised by using `pcall`.

For example, no server instance is running when nobody is playing in the server. The PrivateServerId will be consistent across all of these server instances, the `DataModel/JobId` will be unique for each once.

/** Smoke is one of several particle-emitting classes. Like other particle emitters of its kind, Smoke objects emit particles when parented to a `BasePart` (such as a `Part`) or an `Attachment` within such a `BasePart`. Compared to the `ParticleEmitter` class, Smoke lacks many different customization properties and special methods, such as `ParticleEmitter/Lifetime` or `ParticleEmitter/Emit`. It is useful to create a quick special effect in a pinch; for more detailed work it is preferable to use a `ParticleEmitter` instead.

![Smoke rising from the part to which it was parented](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/blt3634602492a8e3eb/Smoke.png)

When `Smoke/Enabled` is toggled off, particles emit by this object will continue to render until their lifetime expires. When a Smoke object’s `Instance/Parent` is set to nil (and/or `Instance/Destroy`ed), all particles will instantly disappear. If this effect is not desired, try hiding the parent object at a far away position, then removing the Smoke after a few seconds using `Debris` to give the last particles a chance to expire. This object does not have a `ParticleEmitter/Clear` method, but it is possible to set the `Instance/Parent` to nil and back to the exact same object for the same effect.

/** A `Sound` is an object that emits sound. See `Articles/Adding Sounds|Adding Sounds` for more info on how to upload a sound file.

### 2D and 3D Sound

A sound placed in a `BasePart` or an `Attachment` will emit its sound from that part’s `BasePart/Position` or the attachment’s `Attachment/WorldPosition`. A sound exhibits the Doppler effect, meaning its frequency and pitch varies with the relative motion of whatever attachment or part it is attached to. The volume of the sound will be determined by the distance between the client’s sound listener (by default the `Camera` position) and the position of the sound’s parent. For more information on this see `Sound/RollOffMode`.

A sound is considered “global” if it is not parented to a `BasePart` or an `Attachment`. In this case, the sound will play at the same volume throughout the entire place.

### Sound Replication

Sound playback is not filtered. If a particular client starts playing a sound, all of the other clients will also play it unless `SoundService/RespectFilteringEnabled` is set to true.

ImportantWhile the playback of sounds will replicate, other properties such as the playback speed, pitch, volume, etc. will not replicate.

- **Inverse:** Volume attenuates from `Sound/EmitterSize` in an inverse manner
- **InverseTapered:** A hybrid model. Follows the Inverse model when close to `Sound/EmitterSize` and the Linear Square model when close to `Sound/MaxDistance`.
- **Linear**: Volume attenuates between `Sound/EmitterSize` and `Sound/MaxDistance` with a linear relationship.
- **LinearSquare:** Volume attenuates between `Sound/EmitterSize` and `Sound/MaxDistance` with a linear squared relationship

**Inverse vs Linear Distance Attenuation**

By default sounds are set to use inverse distance attenuation (Enum.RollOffMode.Inverse) which mirrors how sounds attenuate in the real world. Under inverse distance attenuation, sounds will begin to attenuate once the distance between the listener and the Sound’s parent exceeds `Sound/EmitterSize`. The rate of attenuation depends on the emitter size, as sounds with larger EmitterSize’s will attenuate at a slower rate. Inverse rate of inverse distance attenuation is further influenced by `SoundService/RolloffScale`.

Note, `Sound/MaxDistance` will not effect attenuation under the inverse model but will cause the sound to cut off completely once this distance is reached. This can be particularly abrupt when using low values for max distance.

Linear distance attenuation works differently. Under linear distance attenuation the sound will attenuate between `Sound/EmitterSize` and `Sound/MaxDistance`, falling silent once MaxDistance is reached. `Sound/EmitterSize` still denotes the point at which the sound will begin attenuating. However, the audible volume at any point now depends on the point the listener is at between EmitterSize and MaxDistance. This means, in contrast to the inverse distance attenuation model, the audible volume of the sound will approach silence at MaxDistance point.

Like all other `SoundEffect`, a ChorusSoundEffect can be applied either to a `Sound` or `SoundGroup` by being parented to either.

A compressor has several properties which determine how it works. The `CompressorSoundEffect/Threshold` is the audio level where the compressor will start to lower the volume. As soon as the source goes below the threshold, the compressor will stop lowering the volume.

The `CompressorSoundEffect/Attack` determines how long it takes for the compressed effect to fully apply. After the threshold has been crossed the compressor will lower the volume over time until the desired ratio has been reached. It will take the time specified by Attack to reach this ratio.

The `CompressorSoundEffect/Release` determines how long it takes for the compressor to remove its effect. After the volume of the source is under the threshold, the compressor will restore the volume back to the original over the time specified by Release.

Along with lowering the volume when the sound has passed the threshold, a compressor will also amplify the entire sound (after any threshold lowering has taken effect).

/** Sparkles is one of several particle-emitting classes. Like other particle emitters of its kind, Sparkles objects emit particles when parented to a `BasePart` (such as a `Part`) or an `Attachment` within such a `BasePart`. Compared to the `ParticleEmitter` class, Sparkles lacks many different customization properties and special methods, such as `ParticleEmitter/Lifetime` or `ParticleEmitter/Emit`. It is useful to create a quick special effect in a pinch; for more detailed work it is preferable to use a `ParticleEmitter` instead.

![Sparkles emitting from a part](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/bltb4fd95f7dbbb308a/Sparkles.png)

When `Sparkles/Enabled` is toggled off, particles emit by this object will continue to render until their lifetime expires. When a Sparkles object’s `Instance/Parent` is set to nil (and/or `Instance/Destroy`ed), all particles will instantly disappear. If this effect is not desired, try hiding the parent object at a far away position, then removing the Sparkles after a few seconds using `Debris` to give the last particles a chance to expire. This object does not have a `ParticleEmitter/Clear` method, but it is possible to set the `Instance/Parent` to nil and back to the exact same object for the same effect.

Sparkles particles are only emit from the center of `BasePart` to which they are parented. Parenting a Sparkles object to an `Attachment` instead allows customization of the particles’ start position. */

/** StarterGear is a container that is automatically inserted into each `Player` when the player joins the game. When a player spawns, the contents of that player’s StarterGear is copied into the player’s `Backpack`. Additionally, when a player connects to a game that permits gear, all of the appropriate gear `Tool` objects that the player owns are inserted into that player’s StarterGear.

Unlike `StarterPack`, StarterGear is not a service but rather a child of each `Player` object – this means that its contents are player-specific so that each player can have different `Tool`s within their `StarterGear`. It is not replicated to any client, including the owning player.

### Accessing StarterGear

Listening to the `Players/PlayerAdded` event is useful for

```lua
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local toolExamplePrefab = Instance.new("Tool")
toolExamplePrefab.Name = "Example Tool"

-- Accessing StarterGear from Server Script
local function onPlayerAdded(player)
	-- Wait for the StarterGear to be added

	-- Add a Tool to the StarterGear
	local toolExample = toolExamplePrefab:Clone()
	toolExample.Parent = starterGear
end

Players.PlayerAdded:connect(onPlayerAdded)
```

### Allowing Gear

Whether or not gear can be permitted is determined in a place’s settings page under ‘Permissions’. On the permissions page gear can be disabled and enabled by genre and type. To disable gear, ensure all the gear types are not selected.

Individual gear can also be added to a game using the ‘Add to game’ feature in the Roblox catalog. This option can be found on the page of any gear that is on sale. When gear is added to a game in this manner it will appear under the ‘Store’ heading on the game’s page. The owner of the game (group or user) receives a commission when gear is sold in this manner.

### Gameplay Considerations

Before adding any gear to a game, consider the implication of doing so. Gear includes `Script`s and allows the player to perform actions that the developer may not have considered. For example, a navigational gear may allow the player to access a part of the map the developer does not want to be accessed. Weapons allow players with gear to damage other players, possibly without the ability to retaliate. Always play-test games after adding gear to them to make sure there are no abuse cases. */

/** A service-level container whose contents are copied into each `Player`'s `Backpack` when the player spawns. It is generally used to hold `Tools`, but is sometimes used to hold `LocalScript`s to ensure that each player gets a copy.

When a player’s character spawns, the contents of the StarterPack and their `StarterGear` are copied into their `Backpack`. Once a character dies, the `Backpack` is removed and a new one is created – populating it using the contents of `StarterPack` and `StarterGear`.

The StarterPack is used to determine a set of `Tool`s that *all* players will spawn with. If a developer wants to ensure that certain `Tool`s are available to specific players, then they will need to parent the `Tool`s directly to the player’s `Backpack` instead.

Note: while normally the contents of `StarterPack` are predefined, the contents can be changed while the game is running by adding and removing `Tool`s accordingly. These updates will pass onto a player’s backpack when they respawn and their backpacks are reloaded. Changes to the StarterPack should be made by the server.

- When using the default player list users will be grouped and displayed together as a team
- Setting `Player/Neutral` to true will cause the `Player` to be disassociated with the team, however, it will not change `Player/Team` or `Player/TeamColor`
- When a `Player` joins a game, they will be allocated to the team with `Team/AutoAssignable` set to true that has the fewest players. If no auto assignable team is available, `Player/Neutral` will be set to true

- When `SpawnLocation/AllowTeamChangeOnTouch` is set to true, a `Player`'s `Player/TeamColor` will change to `SpawnLocation/TeamColor` when their character touches the `SpawnLocation`

**Optional Extended Team Behaviors**

/** The TeleportService is responsible for transporting `Player|Players` between `Articles/Place|places` and servers.

‘Teleporting’ in Roblox, describes the transportation of `Player|Players` between different places and servers. TeleportService provides a range of functions allowing single or groups of users to be teleported. As Roblox `Articles/Multi Place Games|games` can contain multiple places, you can use the TeleportService to teleport players between different levels.

### Which teleport function should I use?

A variety of teleportation functions are available and are all suitable for different circumstances:

- `TeleportService/Teleport|Teleport` for teleporting a single `Player` to a place
- `TeleportService/TeleportToSpawnByName|TeleportToSpawnByName` for teleporting a single `Player` to a place, spawning at a particular `SpawnLocation`
- `TeleportService/TeleportToPlaceInstance|TeleportToPlaceInstance` for teleporting a single `Player` to a specific server instance in a place that is part of the same game
- `TeleportService/TeleportPartyAsync` for teleporting a group of `Player|Players` to one server in a place that is part of the same game
- `TeleportService/TeleportToPrivateServer` for teleporting a group of `Player|Players` to a reserved server created using `TeleportService/ReserveServer` */

When fetching *teleportData* and the *customLoadingScreen* you are advised to use `TeleportService/GetLocalPlayerTeleportData` and `TeleportService/GetArrivingTeleportGui` instead. This is because these functions can be called immediately without having to wait for this event to fire.

This event should be connected immediately in a `LocalScript` parented to `ReplicatedFirst`. Otherwise, when the connection is made the event may have already fired.

### Loading screen

During a teleport, whilst the destination place is loading, the *customLoadingScreen* is parented to the `CoreGui`. Once the place has loaded the `ScreenGui|loading screen` is `Instance/Parent|parented` to *nil*.

If you wish to preserve the *customLoadingScreen* and perform your own transitions, you will need to parent it to the `Players/LocalPlayer|LocalPlayer’s` `PlayerGui`. For example, using the following code inside a `LocalScript` in `ReplicatedFirst`:

```lua
local TeleportService = game:GetService("TeleportService")
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local ReplicatedFirst = game:GetService("ReplicatedFirst")

TeleportService.LocalPlayerArrivedFromTeleport:Connect(function(customLoadingScreen, teleportData)

    customLoadingScreen.Parent = playerGui
    -- animate screen here

    -- destroy screen
    customLoadingScreen:Destroy()
end)
```

Note, the *customLoadingScreen* will not be used if the destination place is in a different game. */

	/** This event fires if a request to teleport (from a function such as `TeleportService/Teleport`) fails and the player does not leave the current place server.

It is fired on both the client and the server.

It includes a *teleportResult* argument (a `Enum/TeleportResult` enum) describing the reason the teleport failed along with the error message that is displayed to the user.

It is possible for teleportation to fail after the `Player` has left the place due to Roblox server issues. This event will not fire in this case and the user will be disconnected and required to rejoin.

### TeleportResult

The `Enum/TeleportResult` indicates the state of the teleport which can be one of several enum values:

    local placeId = teleportData.placeId
    local jobId = teleportData.JobId
end)

	GetLocalPlayerTeleportData(): unknown;
	/** This function retrieves a teleport setting saved using `TeleportService/SetTeleportSetting` using the given key.

This method is intended for use on the client only and should not be used on the server.

Teleport settings are preserved across teleportations within the same game. This means data can be saved using `TeleportService/SetTeleportSetting` in one place and retrieved using GetTeleportSetting in another place the user has been teleported to.

For example, in a game that allowed crouching you could save whether the user is currently crouching prior to teleporting as a teleport setting. This could then be retrieved in the destination place after the teleportation:

```lua
local TeleportService = game:GetService("TeleportService")

local isCrouching =  TeleportService:GetTeleportSetting("isCrouching")
```

If no teleport setting exists under the given key, this function will return *nil*.

### Differences from GlobalDataStores

Although they share some similarities, there are some key differences between teleport settings and datastores:

- `GlobalDataStore/SetAsync` stores the data on Roblox servers whereas SetTeleportSetting stores the data locally
- Data stored in a `GlobalDataStore` is preserved after the user leaves the game universe whereas teleport settings are not
- `GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` can only be accessed on the server, whereas teleport settings can only be accessed on the client
- `GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` have usage limits, whereas teleport settings do not

In general teleport settings should be used to preserve client side information within a single play session across different places in a game. `GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` should be used to save important player data that needs to be accessed across player sessions.

### Teleport settings and security

As teleport settings are stored locally, it is possible they can be manipulated by malicious users. This risk can be mitigated by employing server side validation, for more information on this please see the article on `Articles/Game Security`. */
	/** @rbxts client */
	GetTeleportSetting(setting: string): unknown;
	/** This function sets the custom `ScreenGui|teleport GUI` that will be shown to the local user during teleportation, prior to the teleport being invoked.

Note, the `ScreenGui|teleport GUI` will not be used if the destination place is in a different game. It will also not persist across multiple teleports and will need to be set prior to each one.

This function should only be used on the client. If the teleportation function is called from the server (as is the case with `TeleportService/TeleportPartyAsync`) then this function should be called on the client prior to this. One way of doing this is listening to a `RemoteEvent` that fires several seconds before teleportation.

```lua
-- Client

local TeleportService = game:GetService("TeleportService")
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")
local Players = game:GetService("Players")

local localPlayer = Players.LocalPlayer
local teleportGui = Instance.new("ScreenGui") -- for demonstration purposes

-- this RemoteEvent needs to be created on the server and fired before teleporting
local teleportEvent = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("TeleportPrepare")

-- set the teleport gui so we are ready
TeleportService:SetTeleportGui(teleportGui)

teleportEvent.OnClientEvent:Connect(function()
    -- show the gui prior to the teleport
    local playerGui = localPlayer:WaitForChild("PlayerGui")
    teleportGui.Parent = playerGui
end)
```

### Loading screen

During a teleport, whilst the destination place is loading, the *customLoadingScreen* is parented to the `CoreGui`. Once the place has loaded the `ScreenGui|loading screen` is `Instance/Parent|parented` to *nil*.

This `ScreenGui` can be fetched at the destination place using `TeleportService/GetArrivingTeleportGui`, allowing you to parent it to the `PlayerGui` and perform your own transitions.

You are advised to also `Instance/Parent|parent` the `ScreenGui` to the `PlayerGui` in the start place whilst the teleport is initiating. */
	/** @rbxts client */
	SetTeleportGui(gui: ScreenGui): void;
	/** This function stores a value under a given key that persists across all teleportations in the same game.

This method is intended for use on the client only and should not be used on the server.

For example, in a game that allowed crouching you could save whether the user is currently crouching prior to teleporting as a teleport setting:

```lua
local TeleportService = game:GetService("TeleportService")

local isCrouching = false
TeleportService:SetTeleportSetting("isCrouching", isCrouching)
```

The stored value can take one of the following forms:

- A table without mixed keys (all strings or all integers)
- A string
- A number
- A bool

If data is already stored under the given key, the previous value will be overwritten by the new value.

### Differences from GlobalDataStores

Although they share some similarities, there are some key differences between teleport settings and datastores:

- `GlobalDataStore/SetAsync` stores the data on Roblox servers whereas SetTeleportSetting stores the data locally
- Data stored in a `GlobalDataStore` is preserved after the user leaves the game universe whereas teleport settings are not
- `GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` can only be accessed on the server, whereas teleport settings can only be accessed on the client
- `GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` have usage limits, whereas teleport settings do not

In general teleport settings should be used to preserve client side information within a single play session across different places in a game. `GlobalDataStore|GlobalDataStores` should be used to save important player data that needs to be accessed across player sessions.

### Teleport settings and security

As teleport settings are stored locally, it is possible they can be manipulated by malicious users. This risk can be mitigated by employing server side validation, for more information on this please see the article on `Articles/Game Security`. */

	SetTeleportSetting(setting: string, value: RbxInternalTeleportData): void;
	/** This function teleports a `Player` to the place associated with the given *placeId*.

Teleport can be called both from the client and the server (see examples below).

When teleporting from the client, as only the `Players/LocalPlayer` can be teleported, no *player* argument is required.

You may only teleport players to places within the same game or active start places for other games.

### Teleport data

A *teleportData* parameter can be specified. This is data the client will transmit to the destination place and can be retrieved using `TeleportService/GetLocalPlayerTeleportData`.

The *teleportData* can take any of the following forms:

- A table without mixed keys (all keys are strings or integers)
- A string
- A number
- A bool

As the *teleportData* is transmitted by the client it is not secure. For this reason it should only be used for local settings and not sensitive items (such as the users’ score or in-game currency).

If you need teleport data to persist across multiple teleports, you can use `TeleportService/SetTeleportSetting` and `TeleportService/GetTeleportSetting`.

### Loading screen

A *customLoadingScreen* argument can be specified. This is a `ScreenGui` that is copied (without scripts) into the `CoreGui` of the destination place.

Note, `TeleportService/SetTeleportGui` is the preferred alternative to the *customLoadingScreen* argument as it can be called prior to the teleport.

The loading `ScreenGui` can be obtained in the destination place using `TeleportService/GetArrivingTeleportGui`, where developers can parent it to the `PlayerGui`. It will not be used if the destination place is in a different game.

### Teleport failure

In some circumstances a teleport may fail. This can be due to the developer configuring the teleport incorrectly or issues with Roblox’s servers.

- If a teleportation request is rejected the `TeleportService/TeleportInitFailed` event will fire the error message and a `Enum/TeleportResult` enumerator describing the issue
- Teleports can fail ‘in transit’, after the user has left the server, due to issues with Roblox’s servers. In this case the user will be shown an error message and be required to rejoin the game

### Alternative teleport functions

Before using Teleport, you should check to see if an alternative teleport function is more suitable:

- `TeleportService/TeleportToSpawnByName` is used to teleport a player to a place and spawn them at a specific `SpawnLocation`
- `TeleportService/TeleportPartyAsync` is used to teleport a group of players together to the same server
- `TeleportService/TeleportToPlaceInstance` is used to teleport a player to a specific server in a place
- `TeleportService/TeleportToPrivateServer` is used to teleport a player to a reserved server created using `TeleportService/ReserveServer`

This function can not be used to teleport `Player|Players` to servers created using `TeleportService/ReserveServer` (reserved servers). For this, see `TeleportService/TeleportToPrivateServer`.

### Spawn name

An optional *spawnName* parameter can be provided, which will cause the `Player` to initially spawn at the `SpawnLocation` of that name in the destination place. The `SpawnLocation` must be valid for the `Player` to spawn on. For example, it must be `SpawnLocation/Neutral|neutral` or set to the same `SpawnLocation/TeamColor|TeamColor` as the `Team` the `Player` will be assigned to upon joining the game.

You should be aware of the following limitations when using this function:

- This function can only be called by the server
- This function may fail to return the correct information if the user is teleporting
- It is possible for this function to throw an error, hence developers should wrap it in a pcall (see example below)
- As this function returns the `DataModel/JobId` of the server and not the access code returned by `TeleportService/ReserveServer` the id returned is not appropriate for use with reserved servers

	/** This function returns an access code that can be used to teleport players to a reserved server, along with the `DataModel/PrivateServerId` for it.

### Reserved Servers

The following are characteristics of reserved servers:

- They can only be accessed using `TeleportService/TeleportToPrivateServer`, with the access code ReserveServer returns
- A game server is started when the access code is first used
- No more than one game server instance can exist at any time for each access code
- Access codes remain valid indefinitely, meaning reserved servers can still be joined if no game server is running (in this case a new game server will be started)

You can see if the current server is a reserved server by using the following code:

```lua
local isReserved = game.PrivateServerId ~= "" and game.PrivateServerOwnerId == 0
```

The `DataModel/PrivateServerId` is constant across all server instances associated with the server access code, the `DataModel/JobId` is not. */

	/** This function teleports a group of `Player|Players` to the same server instance in the given place. It returns the `DataModel/JobId` of the server instance the players were teleported to.

This function can only be called from the server.

You may only use this function to teleport to a place in the same game. This function can not teleport more than 50 `Player|Players` in a single party.

Currently this function may not work reliably when teleporting `Player|Players` to the same place they are currently in.

### Teleport data

A *teleportData* parameter can be specified. This is data the clients will transmit to the destination place and can be retrieved using `TeleportService/GetLocalPlayerTeleportData`.

The *teleportData* can take any of the following forms:

- A table without mixed keys (all keys are strings or integers)
- A string
- A number
- A bool

As the *teleportData* is transmitted by the client it is not secure. For this reason it should only be used for local settings and not sensitive items (such as the users’ score or in-game currency).

### Loading screen

A *customLoadingScreen* argument can be specified. This is a `ScreenGui` that is copied (without scripts) into the `CoreGui` of the destination place. It can be retrieved at the destination place using `TeleportService/GetArrivingTeleportGui` and will not be used if the destination place is in a different game.

You are advised to instead set the loading screen on the client using `TeleportService/SetTeleportGui`. The loading `ScreenGui` should also be parented to the `Player|Players'` `PlayerGui|PlayerGuis` a few seconds before the teleport to ensure a smooth transition using a `RemoteEvent`. For an example of this see `TeleportService/SetTeleportGui|SetTeleportGui`.

### Teleport failure

In some circumstances a teleport may fail. This can be due to the developer configuring the teleport incorrectly or issues with Roblox’s servers.

- If a teleportation request is rejected the `TeleportService/TeleportInitFailed` event will fire the error message and a `Enum/TeleportResult` enumerator describing the issue

### Usage

This method should be called once each time a user submits a message. Do not cache the results of this function and re-use them for separate messages. If a user submits the same text multiple times this method must be called again each time the message is sent. If the results are cached and reused spam detection and many forms of context-aware filtering will be broken and potentially put user safety at risk. Games that improperly use cached results may face moderation.

However, it is encouraged to keep these result objects to display the same message to users who join the server later. For example: this can be used to safely and efficiently implement a server chat log that always uses the least restrictive filtering for users who join later, or for efficiently displaying text like a pet name to a user who joins the game after the pet was first spawned and name filtered.

The optional `Enum/TextFilterContext` parameter will not impact the filtered result of the query. This value will be used to improve Roblox’s text filtering.

Private text is anything that is seen only by specific players, rather than every player. For example, if the chat is seen by a single player, or by a selected group of players, then the chat is considered private. Chat for teams or chat that is potentially visible to a wider group, such as the server, is considered public. If you are unsure what your text qualifies as, leave the optional field blank.

### Notes

- This method always yields to make a text filtering service call
- This method may throw if there is a service error that can not be resolved. If this function throws an error please do not retry the request; this method implements it’s own retry logic internally. If this method fails do not display the text to any user.
- This method currently throws if *fromUserId* is not online on the current server. We plan to support users who are offline or on a different server in the future. */

This will prevent collisions from models the client has network ownership of (such as the player’s character) from registering.

/** The Trail object is used to create a trail like an effect between two points. As the points move through space a texture is drawn on the plane the points define. This is commonly used to create effects to help visualize movements like tracer trails behind projectiles, footprints, tire tracks, and many other similar effects.

![A diagram explaining the Trail object.](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b3c158168a9cd0a78be548e/TrailSegments2.png)

![An example usage of the Trail object.](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b3bf11cca8406e05d8a0c3d/Trail.gif)

When a Trail is active it will record the position of it’s `Trail/Attachment0` every frame. It then connects these positions to where the attachments were in the previous frame, creating a polygon. That polygon is then filled in with the Trail’s `Trail/Color` and `Trail/Texture` (if that Texture exists). Each segment drawn in this way will eventually fade based on the TrailEffect’s `Trail/Lifetime`.

### Creating Trails

 In order for a Trail to work properly, it must be a descendant of the \`Workspace\` and its attachment properties (\`Trail/Attachment0\` and \`Trail/Attachment1\`) must be set to two unique Attachments. Once this has been done the effect will create a trail as soon as either of its attachments moves. ![Basic Trail](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b3bf0d568a9cd0a78be5462/BasicTrail.gif)

It is common practice to either store the Trail in the `BasePart` containing the effect’s attachments, or as a child of a `Folder` in the Workspace with other effects objects. */

The lifetime of a trail is also used by that effect’s `Trail/Color` and `Trail/Transparency` properties to determine how each segment is drawn. Both of these properties are sequences, meaning that they define their values at certain keypoints in the segement’s lifetime and then interpolate between the values as the segment ages.

Note that changing MaxLength will only affect new segments that are drawn – any old segments that have already been drawn will maintain their current length.

This value can be any number greater than or equal to 0, and defaults to 0. If the property is set to 0, the maximum length will be infinity - meaning that the trail will not have a maximum length.

Please note that, even if this property is 0, or another large number, the trail is still constrained by its `Trail/Lifetime`. Old segments will be erased if they reach the end of their lifetime, even if the trail is shorter than the maximum length. Be sure to set both properties fittingly.

TextureMode defaults to *Stretch*

\###Stretch

 Stretch is the default TextureMode for Trails. In this mode the texture will be tiled a number of times equal to the number defined by TextureLength. It will stretch these tiles evenly to fit the entire length of the drawn trail. For example, if TextureLength is set to 4 then the texture will always repeat 4 times in the trail, no matter how long or short the trail is.

![Demonstrating a trail texture using the stretch mode.](https://developer.roblox.com/assets/5b3fe640cbdac88b0b7f2df2/TrailStretch.gif)

\###Wrap

 In the Wrap mode, the texture will start at the attachment points and will move as the attachments move. As soon as the attachments have moved a number of studs equal to the TextureLength, then the texture will repeat. The longer the trail is, the more times the texture will repeat.

```

For example, if the trail’s attachments are 2 stud’s apart, and the value of this property is 0.5, the trail’s width will be 1 stud and the trail will be centered in between the two attachments.

/** A UIListLayout lays out sibling UI elements in a single row within the parent UI element, either horizontally or vertically. Each sibling UI element retains its original `GuiObject/Size`, but its `GuiObject/Position` will be taken under control by the UIListLayout. While under control, the Position property of sibling UI elements will not be editable in the Properties window.

By default, it lays out elements from top to bottom in **alphabetical** order, but this can be changed to use elements’ `GuiObject/LayoutOrder` by changing `UIListLayout/SortOrder` to LayoutOrder. A UIListLayout will automatically re-layout elements when elements are added/removed, or if a relevant property changes: `GuiObject/LayoutOrder`, `Instance/Name` or `GuiObject/Size`. This can be triggered manually by calling `UIGridStyleLayout/ApplyLayout`, though this is typically not necessary.

Since each property that changes how elements are laid out will re-apply the layout, it’s recommended to set the `Instance/Parent` property last so that the layout is only applied once. Similarly, since adding more UI elements will also re-apply the layout, add the UIListLayout last so it doesn’t recalculate positions after each element.

This class is perhaps the simplest of all `UIGridStyleLayout` classes. It saves time by skipping the step of setting each UI element’s Position. In the simplest case, laying out UI elements in a column can be as simple as a single line of code:

```lua
Instance.new("UIListLayout", guiObject).SortOrder = Enum.SortOrder.Layout
```

The above line is a useful shorthand when adding a single object to a parent and setting one property. For multiple properties, use a variable:

```lua
local uiListLayout = Instance.new("UIListLayout")
uiListLayout.SortOrder = Enum.SortOrder.Layout
uiListLayout.FillDirection = Enum.FillDirection.Horizontal
uiListLayout.HorizontalAlignment = Enum.HorizontalAlignment.Right

/** The `UserInputService` is a service used to detect and capture the different types of input available on a user’s device.

The primary purpose of this service is to allow for games to cooperate with multiple forms of available input - such as gamepads, touch screens, and keyboards. It allows a `LocalScript` to perform different actions depending on the device, and in turn, helps developers provide the best experience for the end user.

Some usages of this service include detecting user input when they interact with GUIs, tools, and other game instances. In order to detect user input, the service must look for a service event. For example, the service can detect events such as when the user touches the screen of a mobile device using `UserInputService/TouchStarted`, or connects a gamepad such as an Xbox controller to their device using `UserInputService/GamepadConnected`.

Since this service is client-side only, it will only work when used in a `LocalScript` or a `ModuleScript` required by a `LocalScript`. As UserInputService is client-side only, users in the game can only detect their own input - and not the input of others.

This event fires whenever the user tries to make their `Player/Character` jump. Default behavior responds to a jump request by setting the player’s `Humanoid/Jump` property to true, which makes the player’s character jump.

The event can be used to track every time a player wants to jump. Instead of using it to make a player jump, this should be used to change default jump behavior - such as disabling jumping.

For example, the code below prints “Jump” every time the player sends a jump request.

```lua
local userInputService = game:GetService("UserInputService")

function jumpRequest()
    print("Jump!")
end

userInputService.JumpRequest:Connect(JumpRequest)
```

Since this event fires multiple times for a single jump request, using a [debounce](https://developer.roblox.com/articles/Debounce) is suggested.

This can be done by changing the CFrame of the user’s in-game limbs to match the CFrame changes of the VR device using the `Enum/UserCFrame` enum and *CFrame* value arguments passed by the event.

To retrieve the `DataType/CFrame` of a connected VR device, use `UserInputService/GetUserCFrame`.

As the event fires locally, it can only be used in a `LocalScript`.

/** The VRService is a service that is responsible for handling interactions between Roblox and Virtual Reality (VR). If you’re interested in incorporating VR compatibility into your game, this is the service for you!

The primary purpose of this service is to allow for games to communication and cooperate with virtual reality decisions - such as VR headsets and controllers. It allows a LocalScript to perform different actions depending on the device, and in turn, helps developers provide the best experience for the end user seeking to experience Roblox using VR devices.

Some usages of this service include detecting whether a user has any connected VR devices, tracking when those devices move, and determining how those devices interact with the user’s in-game controls. In order to detect user input, the service must look for a service event. For example, the service can detect VR device movement via events such as `VRService/UserCFrameChanged`.
